<li><div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Suppose we want to find the greatest common divisor of, say, <span class="process-math">\(261\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(231\text{.}\)</span> Have students recall (perhaps by verifying a specific example) that, if a number divides both <span class="process-math">\(261\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(231\text{,}\)</span> then it divides <span class="process-math">\(261-231=30\)</span> as well. Similarly, if a number divides both <span class="process-math">\(231\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span> (as it must if it divides <span class="process-math">\(261\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(231\)</span>), then it divides <span class="process-math">\(231-30=201\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(201-30=171\text{,}\)</span> and<span class="process-math">\(\dots231-30(7)=21\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(\gcd(261,231)=\gcd(231,30)=\gcd(30,21)=\dots\text{.}\)</span> Hence, compute <span class="process-math">\(\gcd(261,231)\)</span> and verify it using a method more familiar to you, such as factor trees.</em></div></li>
<li><div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Prove that the Euclidean algorithm “works” in general to compute <span class="process-math">\(\gcd(m,n)\)</span> for any <span class="process-math">\(m,n\in\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span></em></div></li>
<li><div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the gcds of two or three pairs of numbers. It may benefit students to make the first pair of numbers relatively small and one of the pairs relatively large such that the pair of large numbers has a quick Euclidean algorithm solution which is nonobvious using the method of factor trees. For example, one may use any pair of numbers of the form <span class="process-math">\((n,kn+1)\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(n,k\in\mathbb{N}\text{.}\)</span></em></div></li>
<li><div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Unicode is an updated version of ASCII. Unicode gives a way of encoding information on a computer with <span class="process-math">\(1,114,112\)</span> possible numbers. Only about <span class="process-math">\(10\%\)</span> of them are currently in use; say there are <span class="process-math">\(111,411\)</span> Unicode numbers in use. Does the affine cipher <span class="process-math">\(C\equiv103,011P+34,423\mod111,411\)</span> encrypt Unicode characters monoalphabetically?</em></div></li>
