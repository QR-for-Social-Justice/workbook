{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"74a208","input":"# Shift Ciphers in Sage\n\n## Welcome!\n\nWelcome to your first Sage module for the course! Sage is a bunch of math-centric enhancements to the Python programming language. \n\nDoes that mean you're expected to learn how to program in this course? Not at all! While you're welcome to play around and try to extend your code if you have prior programming experience (come talk to me about your plans if this is the case), most of what you'll be doing involves \"thoughtful copy-pasting\" of existing code.\n\nWhat is \"thoughtful copy/paste\"? When coding is new to people, it's almost impossible to type a line of code that will run without error. Why not find some code that you know will execute and modify it slightly? It's in that modification that one needs to be thoughtful. What do you need to change and why? The goal for this course is that you'll come out with a little more knowledge of how to tweak a single bit of code to suit your needs.\n\nDoes this sound like cheating? It isn't a cop-out. It's helping everyone get to the point where Sage makes sense and will give results. In fact, you have some programming background and are interested in doing more with Sage/Python, there are countless online resources you can visit to augment your learning. (The rest of the free Codecademy Python course is a good start.)\n\n## What's the point?\n\nSo why are we using programming in a cryptography course? Frankly, because no one does cryptography anymore with pen and paper. While this may have been possible in Julius Caesar's time, nowadays cryptography is conducted almost exclusively on computers, by computer programs. In fact, by the end of this course, we'll be doing cryptography this is *literally impossible* to do by hand. This type of cryptography (RSA encryption) keeps credit card info safe online and is one of the most commonly used computer programs today.\n\nEven for older encryption systems like shift ciphers, it's still an enormous time-saver to use a computer to encrypt our messages. My goal in this course is to give you more time to focus on concepts than on the arithmetic and simple computations you need to encrypt shift ciphers. Once you understand the basics of how a cipher works, shifting repetitive tasks to a computer helps you focus on the broader concepts underlying each type of encryption.\n\n## Setting Up\n\nTo this end, our goal is to play around with a small program that will encrypt text using a shift cipher. \n\nWe want to be able to input any plaintext we want and the desired shift. The program should then spit out the ciphertext.\n\nFirst, we'll do an example, encoding the message \"MYSECRET\" using a shift of 3, like the classical Caesar cipher. You'll then use this example to define a function.\n\n**Whenever you see a box of code below and you aren't asked to edit the code box, just click in the box as you pass it, then click the \"Run\" button in the toolbar above.**","pos":0,"type":"cell"}

Say we want to encrypt the letter M from 'MYSECRET'. What do we need to do?\n\n1. Convert the plaintext letter to a plaintext number. \n\nSage does this using the function ``alph.find``. Recall that when Python deals with letters, you have to put apostrophes or quotation marks (it doesn't matter which) around them so that Python realizes they're letters.

(If you didn't get P, try looking over your code above again or asking someone.)\n\nWe now want to store that P as the first letter of our ciphertext. Then we'll add other ciphertext letters one by one until our ciphertext is complete.\n\nIn Python and Sage, adding things one by one is called *appending*. For example, the command to append the letter Q to the variable ``weirdletters`` is ``weirdletters += 'Q'``. The logic behind the `+=` is that we're first adding (`+`-ing) `Q` to the variable `weirdletters`, then we're *redefining* `weirdletters` to be itself plus `Q`. (Re)defining variables in Python is done with `=` signs. So together, we're doing both a `+` and an `=`, hence `+=`. (Don't worry, you won't be required to memorize this; you can always come back to this worksheet to remind yourself.)\n\nBelow, write the code to append `ciphertext_letter` to the variable `ciphertext`.

Thankfully, no!\n\nTo save us from having to write out all this code anytime we want to encrypt a message with a shift cipher, we'll wrap everything up in a **function**. Then, if we want to encrypt the message 'POTATO' using the key $7$, all we'll have to write is\n\n``ShiftEncrypt('POTATO',7)``\n\nJust like a mathematical function like $f(x)=3x+2$, Sage functions have *inputs* or *independent variables* (like $x$ in the example $f(x)=3x+2$) and *outputs* or *dependent variables* (like the $3x+2$). For every input $x$ (for example $x=3$), the function outputs $3$ times that input plus $2$.
