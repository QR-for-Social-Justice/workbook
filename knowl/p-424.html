<div class="para">This paper is focused on critiquing the notion of the neutrality of the mathematics classroom. Hodge defines <em class="emphasis">diversity</em> as cultural diversity, with “culture” including race, ethnicity, home life, class, gender, and the interactions between such categories. Hodge points out that racial groups are a social construct and argues against seeing racial groups as homogeneous. Hodge is oriented toward promoting equity in the mathematics classroom, especially considering mathematics as a “gatekeeper” for careers and life chances in general. Hodge argues that we should see the mathematics classroom as an environment for students which promotes a certain kind of thinking, one that is structured by “relationships among qualities” (376). Per Hodge, students possess ways of speaking, writing, dressing, and thinking determined by their culture (“cultural capital”), and students with cultural capital similar to that deemed “acceptable” or dominant in the classroom generally succeed and are rewarded. This conception of cultural capital brings into question the kinds of “academic success” that math teachers and professors are concerned with promoting. Hodge draws on the work of Moll (1997) to argue for the situation of mathematics education in the cultural realities of students, as well as examining what is regarded as “legitimate” participation in mathematics classrooms.</div>
