<div class="para">Any organized collection of information used to understand or solve a problem is called <em class="emphasis">data</em>. When you think of data, you may think of a long list of numbers which represent a measurement.  However, this isn't generally the most useful way to look at a set of data.  When we look at data, we use <em class="emphasis">data visualizations</em> to help us understand the data more quickly and efficiently.  You're probably familiar with at least one type of data visualization, the graph, but we'll explore some more of the variety of ways in which people look at data in this module.</div>
