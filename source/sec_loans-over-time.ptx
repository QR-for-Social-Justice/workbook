    </p>

    <p><ol>
        <li>
                <p>
        Create a graph, trendline, and interpret the <m>R^{2}</m> value for each type of institution: public nonprofit, private nonprofit, private for-profit. What does it mean?
    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
        Use it to predict average tuition and fees across the country in the current year. How accurate is your prediction?
    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
        What trends over time do you notice in each the three graphs? Describe trends in words, using phrases like <q>increasing</q>, <q>decreasing</q>, <q>increasing slope</q>, <q>decreasing slope</q>. What overall trend do we notice that's common to all three graphs over time?
    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
        The <m>R</m>-squared value that I asked you to show in 1(f) measures what proportion of the variation in the <m>y</m> variable is explained by the trendline. For instance, <m>R^{2}=1</m> means that <m>100\%</m> of the variation in <m>y</m> is explained by the trendline, so the trendline is a perfect fit. Conversely, <m>R^{2}=0</m> means that the trendline explains <m>0\%</m> of the variation in the <m>y</m> variable, so this trendline doesn't fit the data at all.<!-- linebreak -->What percentage of the variation in two-year public college tuition (<m>y</m>) is explained by the variation in year (<m>x</m>)? What about when <m>y=</m> four-year private college tuition? Four-year public college tuition?
    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
        <q>Outliers</q> <term></term> are data that fall far away from the trendline. What outliers do you notice, if any? Interpret these outliers in context: what do they mean for tuition and fees over time, and what possible historical explanations could there be for these outliers?
    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
        <q>Polynomials</q> <term></term> are a special type of mathematical function, or process for turning one number into another. Polynomials are functions of the form <me>f(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_{1}x^{1}+a_{0}</me> sums of powers of <m>x</m>, maybe with constant terms in front. For example, <m>f(x)=x+1</m>, <m>g(x)=17x^{3}-234x+7</m>, and <m>h(x)=-x^{142}+1</m> are all polynomials. The polynomial <m>a(x)=x^{2}+2x+3</m> takes the input <m>1</m> and turns it into the output <m>1^{2}+2(1)+3=6</m>. All numbers which make sense to input are called the <em>domain</em> of the function, and the possible sensical outputs you could get are called the <em>range.</em><!-- linebreak -->What is the domain and range of each of the polynomial trendlines?

        Use this model to predict the tuition cost for a student entering each type of institution in the current academic year. How accurate do you think your prediction is?

        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
        Use the model to predict the tuition cost for a student entering a public two-year college in the academic years <m>2050</m>-<m>2051</m>, <m>2100</m>-<m>2101</m>, and <m>1900</m>-<m>1901</m>. How accurate do you think your predictions are?
    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
        Within (roughly) what domain do you think your trendline can make fairly accurate predictions? Explain.
