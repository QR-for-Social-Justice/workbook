<div class="para">Left-click on your graph. In the top menu under “Chart Tools”, click Design. Click Add Chart Element -&gt; Trendline -&gt; More trendline options. Click on the data you want to make a trendline for. In the right sidebar, select Polynomial and play around with the “Order” until you get a good fit for your data. Check “Display Equation on chart” and “Display R-squared value on chart”. Now, our goal is to get all our <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}\)</span> values larger than roughly 0.96, which is a very large degree of accuracy. If some of your trendlines have <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}\leq0.96\text{,}\)</span> double-click on the offending trendline(s) until the sidebar comes up and increase the “Order” of your polynomial until <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}\gt 0.96\text{.}\)</span>
