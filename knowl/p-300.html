<div class="para">Finally, these notes arose from a course originally taught in the Duke TIP summer program which included an “evening session” in which students were walked through the Python modules found in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "inceResourcesFirstYearCollege2022" missing or not unique]</code>. It is highly recommended to guide students through these modules if they are used, since students without prior coding experience often find Python, especially its ubiquitous and sometimes uninformative syntax error messages, intimidating. The Python modules could also be used as the “backbone” for an independent study on the use of programming in cryptography and/or to introduce the material described above.</div>
