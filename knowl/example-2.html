<p>This activity is almost directly adapted from Dana Ernst's <a class="external" href="https://danaernst.com/setting-the-stage/" target="_blank">"Setting the Stage"</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-15-hidden.html" title="Footnote 15"><sup> 15 </sup></a> inquiry-based learning activity. Get in groups of size 3–4. Group members should introduce themselves - name, pronouns, hobbies outside school, goals for the semester/year, reason they're taking the course. For each of the questions that follow, I will ask you to:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Think about a possible answer on your own.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss your answers with the rest of your group.</p></li>
<li><p>Share a summary of each group's discussion.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">The questions are as follows:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>What are the goals of a college or university education? How does social justice fit in? How does math?</p></li>
<li><p>How does a person learn something new?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the value of making mistakes in the learning process?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we create a safe environment where risk taking is encouraged and productive failure is valued?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As Ernst describes on <a class="external" href="https://danaernst.com/setting-the-stage/" target="_blank">his website</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-16-hidden.html" title="Footnote 16"><sup> 16 </sup></a>, <blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Each time I've run the activity, the responses are slightly different. The responses to the first two questions are usually what you would expect. Question 3 always generates great discussions. The idea of “productive failure” naturally arises when discussing question 4 and I provide them with this language sometime while discussing this question. Listening to the students' responses to question 4 is awesome. It's really nice to get the students establishing the necessary culture of the class without me having to tell them what to do.</p>
<p>After we are done discussing the 5 questions, I elaborate on the importance of productive failure and inform that I will often tag things in class with the hashtag #pf in an attempt to emphasize its value. I also provide them with the following quote from Mike Starbird: “Any creative endeavor is built on the ash heap of failure.” I wrap up the activity by conveying some claims I make about education and stating some of my goals as a teacher.</p>
<p>Claims</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>An education must prepare a student to ask and explore questions in contexts that do not yet exist. That is, we need individuals capable of tackling problems they have never encountered and to ask questions no one has yet thought of.</p></li>
<li><p>If we really want students to be independent, inquisitive, &amp; persistent, then we need to provide them with the means to acquire these skills.</p></li>
</ul>
