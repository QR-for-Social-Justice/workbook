<div class="para">The use of uppercase in the ciphertext and lowercase in the plaintext is a cryptographic convention designed to distinguish the two types of text, especially in partially-deciphered messages; we will often ignore the distinction and say, for example, “<span class="process-math">\(f(p)=p+3\)</span> is the shift cipher with shift <span class="process-math">\(+3\)</span>” where lowercase <span class="process-math">\(p\in\mathcal{P},c\in\mathcal{C}\)</span> denote individual letters. We will commonly refer to a particular <span class="process-math">\(p\in\mathcal{P}\)</span> which we will call simply <em class="emphasis">the plaintext</em> and its image <span class="process-math">\(c:=f(p)\in\mathcal{C}\)</span> (<em class="emphasis">the ciphertext</em>). Notably, for courses without mathematical prerequisites such as that taught by the other using the flow of concepts below, the spaces and notation <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> are hidden, and ciphers are analyzed by analyzing particular <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(p)\text{,}\)</span> as well as determining <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(c)\)</span> given particular <span class="process-math">\(c\in\mathcal{C}\text{.}\)</span>
