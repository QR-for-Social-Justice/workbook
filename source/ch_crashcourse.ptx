    <p>Welcome to the workbook! I hope it is helpful to you. I believe this is one of the first attempts to write a text for a quantitative reasoning course framed around social justice (specifically targeted at higher-ed math faculty) as possible (though the <url href="https://web.stevenson.edu/mbranson/m4tp/" visual="web.stevenson.edu/mbransons/m4tp"><i>Math for the People</i></url>, edited by Mark Branson and Whitney George, contains an excellent selection of plug-and-play modules for such a course). I am indebted to and model my work after the K-12 educators (e.g. Bob Moses, Jonathan Osler) who have been doing this work for decades.</p>
