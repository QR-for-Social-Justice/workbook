<div class="para">In addition, the way mathematics is taught around the world is often indicative of a colonial, Eurocentric narrative in which Europe is a “civilizing” force and the significant contributions of mathematicians from non-European backgrounds are downplayed. Such mathematical leaps as written mathematical records, a place value number system, the technique of measurement, our base 10 number system, the “Pythagorean Theorem”, and algebra all originated outside of Europe and were then used by Europeans to advance their own mathematics (Joseph, 1987). The marginalization of these contributions contributes to the perception of mathematics as independent of economics, politics, and culture; frames mathematical pursuits as confined to a select few (usually white, cisgender, heterosexual men); and enshrines deductive axiomatic logic (i.e. “formal” mathematical proof) as the “only” method of mathematical discovery (Joseph, 1987).</div>
