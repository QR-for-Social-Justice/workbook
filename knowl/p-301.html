<div class="para">In order to introduce more contemporary (i.e., post-<span class="process-math">\(1970\)</span>) cryptography, specifically public-key cryptography, it is recommended to start with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The idea is introduced via discussion of the problem of informing the intended recipient what key to use to send an encrypted message (the <em class="emphasis">key distribution problem</em>), quite a significant issue: if one lives in a government where all Internet traffic is subject to government search, for example, how does one send a message across the world? Students often suggest physically transporting a key or sending a person to tell the recipient the key, but that just reframes the problem in terms of safely getting the key or person physically to the intended location.</div>
