<div class="para">We emphasize the years since 2018 in this analysis because, in 2019, the conservative Heritage Foundation and conservative Christian Family Policy Alliance distributed a model strategy for banning gender-affirming care to state legislators at a conference (Harvard Law Review 2021). In 2020, a conference attendee and South Dakota legislator published a version of the bill seeking to criminalize doctors' provision of puberty blockers and hormones to transgender patients under the age of 16. Similar bills followed the same year: in Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, and South Carolina (Bauer 2020). Though the 2020 bills failed, the language in bills in South Carolina, South Dakota, and Arkansas in 2021 attempting to allow physicians to refuse to treat transgender children shared similar language, which originated in a “Model Conscience Protection Act” published by Kevin Theriot and Ken Connelly of the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom (Theriot and Connelly, n.d.). As we will see below, more and more bills are being proposed, and more are passing, every year since.</div>
