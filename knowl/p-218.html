<dfn class="terminology">1</dfn>.  <em class="emphasis">One may begin by simply giving students various encrypted messages to decode along with a handful of hints. Ask students to work in groups, with one member of each group of 3-4 students serving as the facilitator, the recorder, and the reporter (sharing their work with the class), respectively. For instructors following the order of topics below, it is important that at least one message be a <em class="emphasis">shift cipher</em>, a cipher of form <span class="process-math">\(f(p)=p+k\mod26\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k\in\mathbb{Z}/26\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span> In order for students to be able to systematically decrypt a shift cipher, the message should either be fairly long (students can split the message into pieces when decrypting it) or otherwise rigged so that plaintext ‘e’ is one of the top three most common letters in the plaintext.</em>
