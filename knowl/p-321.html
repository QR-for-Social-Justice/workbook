<div class="para">It is very useful to undergird a discussion of this material with a very elementary introduction to Python programming, since all contemporary cryptography happens on computers and many more recent ciphers are incredibly cumbersome to implement by hand. The website CoCalc <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "CoCalcCollaborativeCalculation" missing or not unique]</code>, by the makers of the SageMath computing software (which runs on top of Python), provides an online interface allowing students to program without installing any Python distributions on their own computers, saving headache. This website is not free, but each student is able to pay about $12 toward “upgrading” their CoCalc projects for one semester. The free version of CoCalc is almost unusable due to lag, so upgrading is recommended. The costs of such an upgrade can be implemented as course fees or more informally. The Python modules, as well as rubrics and solutions used to grade them, can be found at the author’s GitHub page <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "inceResourcesFirstYearCollege2022" missing or not unique]</code>.</div>
