<div class="para">Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or many other identities under the queer and trans umbrella (LGBTQ+ folks for short) have long been targeted by conservative groups in the U.S. Nonetheless, the mid-2010s seemed to many to be a time of increasing acceptance of LGBTQ+ identities; the <em class="emphasis">Time</em> magazine article “The Transgender Tipping Point,” for example, quoted actress and advocate Laverne Cox as saying, “We are in a place now where more and more trans people want to come forward and say, ‘This is who I am.’ […] More of us are living visibly and pursuing our dreams visibly, so people can say, ‘Oh yeah, I know someone who is trans.’ When people have points of reference that are humanizing, that demystifies difference (Katy Steinmetz 2014).”</div>
