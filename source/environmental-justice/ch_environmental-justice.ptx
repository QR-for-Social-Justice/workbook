			A recent article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America put the impact of pollution on communities of color into a full racial-equity framework (2020, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1818859116). On average, the study found that non-Hispanic white people experience a “pollution advantage” of 17% less air pollution exposure than is caused by the goods and services they consume. In contrast, Blacks and Hispanics bear a “pollution burden” of 56% and 63% excess exposure, respectively, relative to the pollution caused by their consumption.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			In April 2020, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health published statistics linking air pollution to higher COVID-19 death rates. Looking at 3,000 counties, the preprint, currently in peer review, found that someone who lives for decades in a county with high levels of fine particulate pollution is 8% more likely to die from COVID-19 than someone who lives in a region that has just one unit (1 g/m3) less of such pollution (medRxiv 2020, DOI: 10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502).
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			These findings follow a 2017 report by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Clean Air Task Force finding that African Americans are exposed to 38% more air pollution than white people and are 75% more likely to live near toxic pollution than the rest of the American population.

		<title>What is environmental justice?</title>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			Protecting the environment is sometimes viewed as a luxury -- something people care about only when they have plenty of leisure time and disposable income. In practice, low-income communities and racialized groups often bear the most severe consequences of environmental degradation and pollution.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Our discussion is centered on <term>environmental justice</term>: the recognition that minority and low-income communities often bear a disproportionate share of environmental costs and the perception that this is unjust.
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			Across the United States, poor and PoC neighborhoods bear an unequal burden from hazardous facilities and waste sites. This pattern is evident nationally as well as on the state and local level.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Pollution is unequally distributed across the country; it is also distributed unequally within individual states, within counties, and within cities.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Hazardous waste sites, municipal landfills, incinerators, and other hazardous facilities are disproportionately located in poor and PoC neighborhoods.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Environmental contaminants may also be carried long distances, affecting communities far from their origin. Some might argue that this is just the way the market works, since richer communities or nations can afford better environmental protection.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Others contend that the issue involves broader questions of human rights and fundamental justice, requiring national policies, or international agreements, to modify the workings of unregulated markets.
		</p>
			</li>

			<term>Environmental classism</term> is the system by which poorer people bear a disproportionate share of environmental costs.

				<term> 5</term>.  <term>[Reading Question]</term> Read the Preface (p. viii-ix) and the Executive Summary (p. x-xv) of the report Toxic Wastes and Race at Twenty: 1987-2007 authored by Robert Bullard et al., then answer the following questions in your own words in complete sentences. Turn your answers in online and bring copies to class on the date below for discussion.
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				What were the findings of the original Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States report?
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				In the original report, it was found that race played more into predicting where toxic waste facilities would be located in the U.S. than other variables like home value, household income, and waste levels generated in industrial areas.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				State three additional findings of the updated Toxic Wastes and Race at Twenty report.
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				Of the estimated 9,000,000 people in the U.S. who live within 3 km of commercial hazardous waste facilities, 5.1 million of them are people of color living in neighborhoods near one or more of these facilities.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				In 44 states, there are disproportionately high percentages of people of color in “host neighborhoods” where toxic waste facilities are located. That is to say that between a host area and a non-host area, there is a much higher percentage of people of color in the host areas than there is in non-host areas. Michigan has the largest difference: 66% of host neighborhoods are made up of people of color, while 19% is made up of people of color in non-host neighborhoods.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				105/149 (70%) metropolitan areas that host toxic waste facilities have disproportionately large populations of people of color, and in 46 of these metropolitan areas, the majority of host neighborhoods are made up of people of color.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Why might industries disproportionately dump toxic waste in areas with high populations of people of color?
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				In the words of the report, polluting industries want to take the “path of least resistance” in dumping toxic waste. The perception may be that people of color will not fight back against the pollution of their neighborhoods with toxic waste because they fear putting their jobs and economic stability at risk.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				People of color are generally more likely to experience poverty, and to have a more difficult time securing high-paying jobs because of racist hiring practices/institutionalized racism in many job markets. The heads of industries may assume that because of this, people of color will resist less- especially because they are already dealing with many other injustices.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				In your own words, describe one recommendation of the report and respond to it. Do you agree or disagree that this recommendation will promote greater justice? Why or why not?
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				One of the recommendations of the report was for Congress to create laws and regulations that would force industries to use production systems that reduce waste and eliminate as much pollution as possible, and to create incentives for industries to reuse, recover, and recycle waste.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				I think that this type of legislation would be a step in the right direction for environmental justice. People of color are disproportionately affected by toxic waste disposal, so regulating the waste and pollution of industry would directly impact neighborhoods with higher populations of people of color. These regulations would also be instrumental in reducing overall global pollution levels.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Protecting the environment is sometimes viewed as a luxury -- something people care about only when they have plenty of leisure time and disposable income. How would you respond to this viewpoint after reading the report?
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				First of all, my opinion is that the responsibility of protecting the environment primarily falls into the hands of the government and big polluting industries. There should be greater restriction and regulation of waste produced by industries. Individual action can’t make an impact significant enough to protect the environment as long as big industry continues to cause pollution and environmental harm at such high rates.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				That being said, I think that it is true that protecting the environment can be a luxury. It can cost a lot of money to recycle, or to drive a fuel-efficient, environmentally-friendly car. Also, wealthier people have the luxury of being able to move out of a neighborhood in which the local environment is toxic/hazardous. Someone who lives in an area around a refinery or some other toxic waste facility isn’t going to make much change to the already-toxic environment by carpooling or recycling, because the waste facility is creating much more environmental damage than any single human could be capable of.

				<term> 12</term>.  <term>[RQ]</term> Hydraulic fracturing (also known as “fracking”) is a method to extract natural gas reserves in shale deposits thousands of feet underground. Fracking activity has increased substantially in recent years, both in the United States and abroad. However, there is very little peer-reviewed research about the affects fracking has public health. There is growing concern that fracking could contaminate local water supplies and ambient air pollution, ultimately resulting in negative public health effects. The article <em>Proximity to Natural Gas Wells and Reported Health Status: Results of a Household Survey in Washington County, Pennsylvania</em> is an “attempt to assess the relationship between household proximity to natural gas wells and reported health symptoms.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Before class: please read the article in its entirety, and answer the following 6 questions. We’ll begin next class by discussing these questions, so complete and well-formed answers are appreciated! Turn in your work online, then bring a copy to class on the date below for discussion.
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				<term>Human Health Impact</term>: Among the studies cited in this paper are two convenience sample surveys (Steinzor et al. 2013 and Ferrar et al. 2013). What is a convenience sample survey? What are some problems with this type of survey?
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				A <term>convenience sample survey</term> is a survey whose subjects are those people who were easiest for the surveyor to interview.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Problems with convenience sample surveys usually stem from the fact that those who are easiest for the surveyor to interview, for example college students, are not representative of the population as a whole. For example, they may be wealthier and more liberal.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				<term>Selection and recruitment of households</term>: How do the authors find their participants to survey? Compare this method to a convenience study which yields more meaningful results, and why?
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				<q>In this study we focused on Washington County in southwestern Pennsylvania, an area of active natural gas drilling. We selected a contiguous set of 38 rural townships within the center of Washington County as our study site in order to avoid urban areas bordering Pittsburgh, which would be unlikely to have ground-fed water wells, and areas near the Pennsylvania border, which might be influenced by gas wells in other states.</q>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Using ArcGIS Desktop 10.0 software (ESRI, Inc., Redlands, CA), we randomly selected 20 geographic points from each of 38 contiguous townships in the study county (Figure 1). We identified an eligible home nearest to each randomly generated sampling point, and visited each home to determine which households were occupied and had ground-fed water wells. We selected households with ground-fed water wells to assess possible health effects related to water contamination. From the original 760 points identified (i.e., 20 points in each of the 38 townships), we excluded 12 duplicate points and 64 points found not to correspond to a house structure (see Supplemental Material, Figure S1).
			</p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				<term>Administration of survey at residence</term>: The authors note that “survey personnel were not aware of the mapping results for gas well proximity to the households being surveyed.” Why is this statement an important thing to mention? How does this relate to the experimental design element known as blinding? (More info about blinding here.)
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				If survey personnel, for example, thought that proximity to natural gas wells was correlated with negative health effects, the tone of their questions and their behavior may lead the survey respondent to consciously or unconsciously modify their responses to fit this narrative. After all, the surveyer is affiliated with a scientist, so they must know what they’re talking about!
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				A <term>blind</term> or <term>blinded study</term> is a scientific study (usually an experiment) in which information about the test is masked (kept) from the participant, to reduce or eliminate bias, until after a trial outcome is known. It is understood that bias may be intentional or subconscious, thus no dishonesty is implied by blinding. If both tester and subject are blinded, the trial is called a <term>double-blind experiment</term>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				In this example, since there are no control or experimental groups, the only person who can be blinded is the experimenter. This is <term>not</term> a double-blind study, just a blinded study.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				<term>Discussion</term>: Describe any potential sources of bias in this study, and explain how such bias could influence or affect the conclusions of the study.
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				<term>Non-sources of bias:</term>
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				“This association persisted even after adjusting for age, sex, smokers in household, presence of animals in the household, education level, work type, and awareness of environmental risks...
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Strengths of the study included the larger sample size compared with previously published surveys, and the random method of selecting households using geographic information system methodology, which reduces the possibility of selection bias (although only a subset of households, those with ground-fed water supply, were sampled).”
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				When a study attempts to diagnose its shortfalls, that’s a good sign!
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p>

				<li>
							<p>
				<term>Limitations/potential sources of bias</term>:
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				reliance on self-report of health symptoms [why is this bad?], which could lead to respondents who are aware of potential health impacts of fracking to overreport their symptoms (<term>recall bias</term>)
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We did not collect data on whether individuals were receiving financial compensation for gas well drilling on their property, which could have affected their willingness to report symptoms. It is possible that differential refusal to participate could have introduced potential for selection bias; for example, individuals who were receiving compensation for gas drilling on their property might be less willing to participate in the survey.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We found instead that the refusal rate, though <m>&lt;25\%</m> overall, was higher among households farther from gas wells, suggesting that such households may have been less interested in participating because they had less awareness of hazards. The study questionnaire did not include questions about natural gas extraction activities, in order to reduce awareness bias. At the same time, it is likely that household residents were aware of gas drilling activities in the vicinity of households; and the fact that reported environmental awareness by respondents was associated with the prevalence of all groups of reported health symptoms suggests a correlation between heightened awareness of health risks and reported health conditions.

			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				Label. Give each client a numerical label, using as few digits as possible. Two digits are needed to label 30 clients, so we use labels 01, 02, 03,…,28, 29, 30. [left of slide] It is also correct to use labels 00 to 29 or even another choice of 30 two-digit labels. Here is the list of clients, with labels attached, using 01 to 30: [slide]
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Table. Enter Table A anywhere and read two-digit groups. Suppose we enter at line 130, which is 69051 64817 87174 09517 84534 06489 87201 97245. The first 10 two-digit groups in this line are 69 05 16 48 17 87 17 40 95 17. Each two-digit group in Table A is equally likely to be any of the 100 possible groups, 00, 01, 02,…, 99. So two-digit groups choose two-digit labels at random. That’s just what we want.
			</p>

			<p>
				Joan used only labels 01 to 30, so we ignore all other two-digit groups. The first five labels between 01 and 30 that we encounter in the table choose our sample. Of the first 10 labels in line 130, we ignore five because they are too high (over 30). The others are 05, 16, 17, 17, and 17. The clients labeled 05, 16, and 17 go into the sample. Ignore the second and third 17s because that client is already in the sample. Now run your finger across line 130 (and continue to line 131 if needed) until five clients are chosen. The sample is the clients labeled 05, 16, 17, 20, 19. These are Bailey Trucking, JL Appliances, Johnson Commodities, MagicTan, and Liu’s Chinese Restaurant.

				How does a statistical study draw conclusions about which hypothesis is true?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				A statistical study is conducted entirely under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. The study then presents evidence in the form of a <term>test statistic</term>, a number that summarizes the responses of the sample. The study calculates a <term><m>p</m>-value</term>, the probability that this test statistic would be observed if the null hypothesis were true. Traditionally, if <m>p&lt;5\%</m> or <m>.05</m>, the null hypothesis is <term>rejected</term> as too unlikely in the face of the evidence.

				<term> 31</term>.  Commonly, test statistics take the form of proportions, percentages, averages, or even more complex formulas.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the basketball example above, our test statistic is the <term>sample proportion</term> <m>\hat{p}</m> of the <m>20</m> observed free throws that were made. So <m>\hat{p}=\frac{8}{20}=0.4</m>. The observer notes that the test statistic <m>\hat{p}=0.4</m> is fairly consistent with the null hypothesis <m>H_{0}:p=0.5</m>. Hence, we <term>fail to reject the null hypothesis</term> in favor of the player’s claim. The null hypothesis that the player is only a <m>50\%</m> free throw shooter stands.

				<term> 33</term>.  The probability, computed assuming <m>H_{0}</m> is true, that the sample outcome would be as extreme or more extreme than the actually observed outcome is called the <term>p-value</term> of the test. The smaller the p-value is, the stronger the evidence against <m>H_{0}</m> provided by the data.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="defn">-->

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				In practice, most statistical tests are carried out by computer software that calculates the P-value for us.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				It is usual to report the p-value in describing the results of studies in many fields.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				You should therefore understand what p-values say even if you don’t do statistical tests yourself, just as you should understand what “95% confidence” means even if you don’t calculate your own confidence intervals.

				Introduction: This study looked at all people who lived within 150 meters of a major roadway. Why did the study choose this number (150) as the cutoff?
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				traffic-related pollutants diminish to near-background levels after <m>150</m> m

				Introduction: What do the authors hypothesize the relationship between socioeconomic status and air pollution exposure is?
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				they hypothesize due to <q>widely accepted</q> evidence that economically poorer people are more likely to be exposed to air pollutants
			</p>

Which of the following interpretations of this confidence statement is accurate? Explain why or why not, relating each statement to the archery analogy when appropriate. (Take your time and digest each statement; some of these are tricky!)

				If the pollsters take 100 polls with different samples, 95 of the resulting sample proportions will fall in this interval.

				<li>
							<p>
				If the pollsters take 100 polls with different samples, we’d expect roughly 95 of the resulting confidence intervals will contain the true population proportion.

				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				If the pollsters take 100 polls with different samples, we’d expect exactly 95 of the resulting confidence intervals to contain the true population proportion.

			<p>
				False, for the same reason that saying exactly <m>500</m> out of <m>1000</m> coin flips will be heads is false.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We can be certain that less than half of voters support the candidate.

			<p>
				False; we can’t be certain of anything here. These are probability statements.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We can be 95% sure that the candidate would lose the election if it were held tomorrow.
			</p>

			<p>
				False; the confidence interval only tells us about random sampling error, not any other form of error.

				”The environmental justice literature suggests that socially disadvantaged groups might experience a phenomenon known as triple jeopardy (37).

			<p><ul>

				First, poor and minority groups are known to suffer negative health effects from social and behavioral determinants of health (e.g., psychosocial stress, poor nutrition, and inadequate access to health care).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Second, as suggested in this analysis, certain populations (e.g., members of minoritized communities, foreign-born persons, and persons who speak a non-English language at home) might be at higher risk for exposure to traffic-related air pollution and fracking-related water and air pollution as a result of residential proximity to major highways.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Third, there is evidence suggesting a multiplicative interaction between the first two factors, such that socially disadvantaged groups experience disproportionately larger adverse health effects from exposure to air pollution (37).”
