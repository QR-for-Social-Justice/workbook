<div class="para">The <em class="emphasis">Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics</em> (NCTM, 1991) recommend that teacher reflection should occur and focus on how students’ linguistic, ethnic, racial, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds influence their learning of mathematics. Within the social reconstructionist tradition, teacher reflection was a political act “that either contributes to or hinders the realization of a more just and humane society” (Zeichner, 1996). However, preservice teachers often view student diversity as a problem rather than a resource, and many teachers hold a view that “all students should be treated equally in the classroom”, even when this leads to disproportionately negative outcomes for students of color. The authors argue that this “one-size-fits-all” mentality is a common, serious obstacle to true teacher reflection and social justice. Further, the authors identify the “color-blind” mentality, in which a teacher claims “not to see color”, to lead to ignoring students’ cultural backgrounds in the classroom, thus decreasing student engagement, as well as a refusal to combat historical and actual racist practices. In classroom observations, the authors report several instances of students being “allowed to fail” through their teacher’s neglect; such students were disproportionately Black, specifically Black men.</div>
