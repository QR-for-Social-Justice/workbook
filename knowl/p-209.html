<div class="para">These activities require no prerequisites other than high school-level algebra skills; the most complicated of which is the solution of systems of two equations in two unknowns, though a more proof-centric approach would benefit from prior student experience with proof techniques. Student proficiency in making factor trees and division with remainder will also be helpful, though these concepts can be reviewed on a just-in-time basis. Students will develop an understanding of the shift cipher, affine cipher, and RSA cryptosystem that is not standard in abstract or modern algebra courses; the only technology required is a calculator capable of reducing expressions modulo n and modular exponentiation, both of which are standard in the Google search box. Students may benefit from programs capable of encrypting and decrypting using shift and affine ciphers such as the open-source tools on the website <a class="external" href="https://cryptii.com" target="_blank">Cryptii</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-68-hidden.html" title="Footnote 68"><sup> 68 </sup></a>, though the author has successfully asked students to write their own programs in Python to perform these tasks.</div>
