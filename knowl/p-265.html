<div class="para"><em class="emphasis">At this point, students have the cheat sheet and tools necessary to decrypt affine ciphers with known key. Have them try decrypting some example ciphertext under various affine ciphers. Naturally, students may at first be most comfortable only doing arithmetic modulo <span class="process-math">\(26\text{,}\)</span> but it takes surprisingly little in my experience to prompt them to consider other moduli. Students may try decrypting affine ciphers in different alphabets at this stage: for example, decrypt <span class="process-math">\(c\equiv7p\mod29\)</span> using the lowercase English alphabet with !?, appended. We need to multiply both sides by some number <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(7x\equiv1\mod29\text{.}\)</span> How do we systematically find <span class="process-math">\(x\text{?}\)</span> This is a great time for an optional detour into the extended Euclidean algorithm; students without much previous college-level math experience often find this difficult, so it may be skipped without losing the thread of this activity.</em></div>
