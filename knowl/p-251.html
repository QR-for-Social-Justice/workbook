<div class="para">At this stage, students are ready to learn the material in a standard integer division and modular arithmetic unit, in the order you wish to present it for your context. For example, the material of Chapters <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> through <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "crismanNumberTheoryContext2021" missing or not unique]</code>, from integer division and Diophantine equations to the so-called “Chinese” (in particular, Sun-tzu) remainder theorem and the theory of cyclic groups, are all motivated by the theory of affine ciphers and can be covered at this stage. We highly recommend calling back to cryptography whenever possible; the following section is an overview of one possible order in which various number-theoretic results can be motivated by the theory of affine ciphers.</div>
