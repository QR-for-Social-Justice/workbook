<div class="para">It is easy to generate example shift ciphertext and have students decrypt this ciphertext. Prompt them to continually investigate the methods they use to cryptanalyze shift ciphers: does it involve brute force? Counting the number of occurrences of each letter and comparing to English letter frequencies, then guessing the most common ciphertext letter corresponds to <span class="process-math">\(e\text{?}\)</span> Spotting patterns between adjacent letters? There is no “wrong” way, but it is the goal of cryptographers to find a general method for decrypting a given family of cipher no matter the particular message or peculiarities of the cipher; therefore, we want to move students’ thinking toward counting letter frequencies as a method of cryptanalyzing any monoalphabetic substitution cipher.</div>
