{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"90eeea","input":"Our goal is to speed up the process of finding powers modulo $p$, where $p$ is some large prime number. **The key insight** is that, to compute, say, $a^{17}\\mod{p}$, it's easiest to first compute $a^{2}$, reduce it modulo $p$, then square the result to get $a^{4}\\mod{p}$, then reduce mod $p$, then square again to get $a^{8}\\mod{p}$, etc., building up to the power of $17$ and reducing at each step. This process is called **modular exponentiation**, and it's built into Python.\n\nIn order to (more) quickly compute $a^{b}\\mod{p}$, type ``pow(a,b,p)``. For example, to compute $18^{32}\\mod{643}$, the Python code is ``pow(18,32,643)``.\n\nIn the code chunks below, write the three lines of code, in order, to more quickly compute the powers in the three previous code chunks with the specified modulus.","pos":8,"type":"cell"}
