    </p>

    <p><ul>

                <p>
        understand the impact of student demographics, type of institution, and time on student loan debt.
    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
        perform exploratory data analysis on a numerical variable (college tuition, student loan debt) as a function of a numerical (year) or categorical (institution type, student demographics) variable.
    </p>

    <p><ul>
        <li>
                <p>
        create line charts of student loan data over time.
    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
        create scatterplots of student loan debt versus college graduation rates.
    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
        create bar charts of the average student loan debt owed by various demographic groups.

    </ul></p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>

    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
        use a chi-squared test for independence to analyze the impact of student demographics (race, gender, and others) on student loan debt load.
    </p>
        </li>

        <li>
                <p>
