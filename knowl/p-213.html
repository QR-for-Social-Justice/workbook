<div class="para">Some individuals, though, benefit more than others.  The corporations that produce the goods we buy - our cars, plastics, electronics, and food - are motivated to keep selling more stuff, even if that stuff produces greenhouse gas emissions.  Fossil fuel companies make money by extracting and selling fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, and petroleum.  All of this economic activity contributes to government tax revenues, which allows politicians to spend more money on their constituents and special interests.</div>
