<div class="para">Data which can be represented numerically is called quantitative data.  This includes both data which is already numerical, and data which can be made numerical.  Dates are a good example of quantitative data that isn't always written in numbers (for example, "March" doesn't seem numerical, but can be represented by 3 since it is the 3rd month of the year).</div>
