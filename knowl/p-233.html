<div class="para">The usefulness of the clock metaphor for introducing modular arithmetic cannot be overstated: we are thinking of the alphabet as a clock with <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> numbers on it, going from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> on the top to <span class="process-math">\(25\text{.}\)</span> Can students determine various times on this clock? Up until this point, students were not likely to fully understand our definition of a cipher as a function modulo <span class="process-math">\(26\text{,}\)</span> but now they can. The following activity is one Iâ€™ve used to help students learn basic modular arithmetic without any prerequisites:</div>
