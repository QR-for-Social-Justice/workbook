<div class="para">Learning about elementary ciphers has historically provided even first-year students with the motivation and context to gain experience and facility with modular arithmetic, including the idea of multiplicative inverses and the structure of finite cyclic groups. These ideas could easily lead to an examination of a broader range of group theory, for example in the context of an abstract algebra course, or become the first few weeks of a seminar course on the mathematics of code-making and code-breaking without prerequisites, as it has been implemented at the authorâ€™s institution. These notes are more than suitable for independent study or summer programs for motivated high-school students; in fact, this is how they first originated.</div>
