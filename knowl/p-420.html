<div class="para">We only include bills in categories tracked by both data sources; this leaves out, for example, bills preventing localities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances within a state. We use a broad reading of the “religious freedom” category to include bills that allow for people with “sincerely-held religious beliefs” in that state to challenge nondiscrimination laws, discriminate against LGBTQ+ people, refuse to provide healthcare to LGBTQ+ people, refuse to provide adoption services to LGBTQ+ people; discriminate against married LGBTQ+ people, and receive funding for discriminatory student groups at public universities, among others.</div>
