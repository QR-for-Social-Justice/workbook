<title>The Intersectional Inequities of Student Debt</title>
<!-- div attr= class="xca*"-->
    <p>
        The average undergraduate student who takes out student loans has around <m>\$25,000</m> in debt by the end of their higher education, according to the U.S. Department of Education. However, this debt is not spread equitably by demographic category: <url href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230122063133/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/26/your-money/student-loan-forgiveness-debt.html" visual="nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/26/your-money/student-loan-forgiveness-debt.html"><m>30\%</m> of non-Hispanic-identifying Black families carry an education loan, compared to <m>20\%</m> of non-Hispanic white families and <m>14\%</m> of Hispanic-identifying families</url>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Student debt is also not equally spread among age groups; Millennials (who were <m>30</m>-<m>39</m> years old in <m>2021</m>) total over <m>\$500</m> billion in student loan debt, compared to a little over <m>\$350</m> million of Gen Z (under <m>30</m> in <m>2021</m>), a little under <m>\$350</m> million held by those <m>40</m>-<m>49</m> years of age in <m>2021</m>, a bit under <m>\$250</m> million held by those <m>50</m>-<m>59</m> years old, and <url href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230122063133/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/26/your-money/student-loan-forgiveness-debt.html" visual="nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/26/your-money/student-loan-forgiveness-debt.html">only around <m>\$125</m> million held by those <m>60</m> or older in <m>2021</m> </url>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since Black families have been prevented from amassing generational wealth through systemic racism (in which laws favor one racial group over another), the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, and mass incarceration, as well as continued implicit and explicit racism in public policy, housing (including the legacy of redlining, a policy which conitnued through <m>1977</m>), private banking and lending, access to education, and hiring practices, Black folks are both <url href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED621932" visual="eric.ed.gov/?id=ED621932">more likely to have to take on debt to attend college and less likely to attain wealth due to a college education</url>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In particular, a <m>2013</m> study found that the average white college-educated parent contributed <m>\$73,500</m> to their children's education, while Black parents contributed <m>\$16,000</m> on average. This is true despite the fact that, when controlling by household type and economic situation, Black parents contribute more on average than white parents.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lower-income Black parents are disproportionately likely to take out Parent PLUS loans, which are loans provided by the U.S. Department of Education to the parents of college students. Parent PLUS loans are unsubsidized and charge a <url href="https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/what-is-parent-plus-loan"><q>loan fee</q> (added to each loan payment) of <m>4.228\%</m> and an interest rate of <m>7.54\%</m> as of <m>2022</m> </url>, adding a substantial financial burden to the parent borrower.
    </p>

    <p>
        Under these circumstances, Black borrowers default on student loans five times more often that white borrowers <url href="marka.brownStudentLoansNot2022"></url>. Therefore, the disproportionate load of student debt on Black borrowers is both a symptom of, and exacerbates, the racial wealth gap in the U.S., or the difference in total assets and debts between Black and white Americans.
    </p>

    <p>
        Defaulting on federal student loan debt leads to consequences such as <url href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/e5f160af46c6a00c16709c8f31c7311f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y">bad credit ratings, a decrease in tax refunds, the garnishment of wages, and removal of security clearances which are at times a condition of employment</url>. The consequences for those who default include an inability to obtain loans to buy homes or cars, loss of wages, or loss of employment.

    <title>Reading the News on Student Loans</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Part of quantitative literacy is being able to critically interpret numbers and mathematics in the news media. To that end, find an article from the last four years involving student loans that makes at least 2-3 numerical claims. The <url href="https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/variation-published-priceshttps://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/variation-published-prices">College Board website</url> or reputable news sources (<em>New York Times</em>, <em>Washington Post</em>, Reuters, Associated Press, etc.) about government policy on student loans and loan forgiveness are good sources,; you're welcome to find your own sources as well. Take the number(s) in your article and do the following:
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <exercise>
            <p>
    Decide what point the article is trying to make by citing these numbers.
</p>
</exercise>

    <exercise>
            <p>
    Before pulling out an electronic device, brainstorm a list of questions (3-5) you'd like to know about the numbers–things that would help you understand if the numbers are big or small, and whether or not the underlying data actually supports the article's argument.

    Rate the article's claims on two scales:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
            <p>
    How true is the statement? (0 = completely false, 4 = completely true)
</p>
    </li>

    <li>
            <p>
    How misleading is the statement? (0 = not at all, 4 = totally misleading) (In other words, when you look at the underlying data, does it support the article's point or not?)
