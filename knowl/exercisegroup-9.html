<div class="introduction">Our first goal is to find data. Note that any data found online may change web addresses, stop updating, go offline, or become unreliable over time. Your instructor will be able to tell you which sources of data to use if the ones below are no longer reliable.</div>

<div class="para">Go to the website <a class="external" href="https://tracktranslegislation.com" target="_blank">tracktranslegislation.com</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-90-hidden.html" title="Footnote 90"><sup> 90 </sup></a>, which in turn obtains its data from <a class="external" href="https://legiscan.com" target="_blank">LegiScan</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-91-hidden.html" title="Footnote 91"><sup> 91 </sup></a>, and browse around.

Two things that aren't on the site that you wonder about?</div></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">2<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<div class="para">This data is up-to-date from 2021 through April 21, 2023. In order to track bills prior to 2021, we use data from the ACLU's <a class="external" href="https://www.aclu.org/past-legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country-2018" target="_blank">“Past Legislation Affecting LGBT Rights Across the Country” pages for 2018, 2019, and 2020</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-92-hidden.html" title="Footnote 92"><sup> 92 </sup></a>.</div>

What similarities do you notice with the data found on the Track Trans Legislation website? What differences do you notice? Click on the "View 2019" and "View 2018 Session bills" links and do the same for those years.</div></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">3<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<div class="para">We'd like to get a sense of how anti-trans legislation in the U.S. changed over time, so we're going to try to <em class="emphasis">merge</em> the Track Trans Legislation (TTL) data with the ACLU data. Since the ACLU data has different bill "Status" categories than TTL, we'll need to figure out how to classify each ACLU bill into one of the TTL categories.</div>
<div class="para">Use the <a class="external" href="https://www.tracktranslegislation.com/terminology" target="_blank">Terminology</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-94-hidden.html" title="Footnote 94"><sup> 94 </sup></a> page on the TTL website to answer the following question. Which of the TTL categories would you classify "Referred to committee" into? "Hearing scheduled"? "Withdrawn"? You may want to click on the bill numbers on the ACLU site to see how the website LegiScan, a constantly-updated bill tracker, classifies each bill.</div></article>
