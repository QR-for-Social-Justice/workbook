\textbf{(RQ)}: I developed the attached Google Sheet (requires a Westminster
account to view; please don't share outside the college) in late $2017$
to recruit potential candidates for two math professor job openings
(now filled by the lovely Drs. Spencer Bagley and Bianca Thompson).
Consider the sheet, then answer the following questions about it in
a text box below. (Note that the questions are all different-{}-a
percentage point difference is calculated by simply subtracting percentages,
while a percent is calculated by the formula $\text{(part/whole)}\times100\%$).
Bring a copy of your answers to class on the date below. 

Note that questions (1)-(3) ask you to compare Westminster's demographics
to the demographics of both SLC and Utah.
\begin{enumerate}
\item How many fewer Black or African-American students did Westminster
enroll in 2016-2017 than lived in Salt Lake City (respectively, Utah)
in 2016? The population of SLC in 2016 was about 194,000, and the
population of Utah in 2016 was about 3 million. 
\item How many percentage points fewer Black or African-American students
did Westminster enroll in 2016-2017 than lived in Salt Lake City (respectively,
how many percentage points more than the Utah percentage) in 2016? 
\item What percent of the Black population of Salt Lake City (respectively,
Utah) was enrolled at Westminster in 2016?

\item If you were a member of the Westminster administration, which of the
above six statistics would you cite to emphasize Westminster's diversity? 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $0.48$ percentage points more Black students are enrolled at Westminster
than live in Utah.
\end{enumerate}
\item In your opinion, which of the above statistics most accurately reflects
Westminster's diversity? Explain your answer.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $0.82$ percentage points more Black students live in SLC than are
enrolled at Westminster
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
