  "body": " Getting Started   If you're new to incorporating social justice issues into math classes, I'd encourage you to start by reading or skimming Jonathan Osler's “A Guide for Integrating Issues of Social and Economic Justice into Mathematics Curriculum” , made by a high-school educator but equally relevant in the postsecondary context. Next, Drew Winter's “Infusing Mathematics with Culture” offers a valuable framework for thinking about the relationship between mathematical content and social justice issues, as well as an emphasis on connecting to student activism and interests.  This book is meant to be used as a workbook for students in a quantitative reasoning (QR) course framed around issues of social justice (SJ). This course developed out of my resource folder for open-access SJ math resources ; feel free to mix and match chapters from this book and resources from the folder to plug into existing courses as well as to \"remix\" your own full course.    Why Teach Postsecondary Math for Social Justice?    Culturally relevant teaching practices contribute to educational equity and social justice (McGee 2014)  Teaching math with a social justice frame increases student learning and achievement (Gutstein 2003; Moses & Cobb 2001; Winter 2007)  Math is already political. What assumptions do our algorithms and databases inherit (O'Neill 2016)? What do we think is \"worthy\" of mathematical inquiry? Math with applications to petroleum engineering or fracking (Hendrickson 2015) ? Statistical analyses of police stops by race (Khadjavi 2013 , Ince 2021 )?  See this literature review (Ince 2015) for an investigation of what the research shows about teaching math for social justice.

  "title": "Example SJ Math Activities for the First Day",
  "body": " Example SJ Math Activities for the First Day  Here are some examples of questions I've asked my students, almost always in a think-pair-share format, to start off a semester-long course on quantitative reasoning for social justice.  Defining social justice What do you think of when you think of social justice? What are 2-3 issues of SJ you're passionate about? Can we develop a working definition of SJ as a class?  Some possible answers:  justice in terms of the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a society. (Google Dictionary)  a concept of fair and just relations between the individual and society. (Wikipedia)  a state or doctrine of egalitarianism (Merriam-Webster)  A broad term for action intended to create genuine equality, fairness and respect among peoples. (University of Massachusetts Lowell Department of Multicultural Affairs)    One working definition that my classes have used (due to Sensoy-DiAngelo) is the following. Social justice is a recognition that:  all people are individuals, but we are also members of socially constructed groups;  society is stratified, and social groups are valued unequally;  social groups that are valued more highly have greater access to resources and this access is structured into the institutions and cultural norms;  social injustice is real and exists today;  relations of unequal power are constantly being enacted at both the micro (individual) and macro (structural) levels;  we are all socialized to be complicit in these relations;  those who claim to be for social justice must strategically act from that claim in ways that challenge social injustice; and  this action requires a commitment to an ongoing and lifelong process.     Here are some more examples I've used in courses during the pandemic:  A first-day activity for a pandemic Consider the following questions What are some social justice issues that are important to you in the midst of rising inequality and authoritarianism, climate crisis, racial justice movements, and more? What are some ways we could measure each of these issues? (how bad they are, solutions, societal reactions, etc.) What are some things you don't know how to measure about each of these issues? Estimate: what are some strategies for measuring these things? Don't try to plug in numbers yet, just make a list. What are some ways to, as accurately as possible, measure how severe the COVID-19 outbreak is in your city? Write down any assumptions you make about what “severe” means. If you were a disability rights activist concerned about the dangers of COVID-19 for immunocompromised folks, which of these ways would you choose to measure? Estimate or find the info. If you were an administrator at your college or university, which of these ways would you choose to measure? Explain, then estimate or find the info. What are some things it would be ideal to be able to measure in order to curtail or prevent the spread of COVID-19 in your city? Do the same as above: how would you measure these things as a disability rights activist? As a college administrator? Brainstorm some ways to obtain the measurements you described above. If you obtained these measurements, how could you use them to advocate for positive change? What questions about social justice, health\/accessibility, and math does this activity bring up for you?  You may have come up with questions similar to the following:  How did we measure X?  What's the best way to measure X?  What values are inherent in the way we measure X?  If your goal is to advocate for social justice, how does that change the “best” way of measuring X?    We just demonstrated a couple of tools we'll use many times in the next week or two:  Estimation : round up or down to make calculations easier and numbers less messy. As we saw when estimating the number of classrooms needed for the US household wealth, rounding before the computation ends can introduce error. Therefore, if you have a calculator, it's best to plug into the calculator before rounding, whereas if you're computing by hand, rounding may be necessary in order to increase the accuracy of your computations. Everyone makes arithmetic mistakes–you'll see me do it plenty of times!  Dimensional analysis : start with the given and multiply by fractions, canceling out the units, until you get something in the units your answer should be in. This is almost always your answer!     Setting the stage \"Setting the Stage\" Get in groups of size 3–4. Group members should introduce themselves - name, pronouns, hobbies outside school, goals for the semester\/year, reason they're taking the course. For each of the questions that follow, I will ask you to:  Think about a possible answer on your own.  Discuss your answers with the rest of your group.  Share a summary of each group's discussion.  The questions are as follows:  What are the goals of a college or university education? How does social justice fit in? How does math?  How does a person learn something new?  What is the value of making mistakes in the learning process?  How do we create a safe environment where risk taking is encouraged and productive failure is valued?   As Ernst describes on his website , Each time I've run the activity, the responses are slightly different. The responses to the first two questions are usually what you would expect. Question 3 always generates great discussions. The idea of “productive failure” naturally arises when discussing question 4 and I provide them with this language sometime while discussing this question. Listening to the students' responses to question 4 is awesome. It's really nice to get the students establishing the necessary culture of the class without me having to tell them what to do.  After we are done discussing the 5 questions, I elaborate on the importance of productive failure and inform that I will often tag things in class with the hashtag #pf in an attempt to emphasize its value. I also provide them with the following quote from Mike Starbird: “Any creative endeavor is built on the ash heap of failure.” I wrap up the activity by conveying some claims I make about education and stating some of my goals as a teacher.  Claims   An education must prepare a student to ask and explore questions in contexts that do not yet exist. That is, we need individuals capable of tackling problems they have never encountered and to ask questions no one has yet thought of.  If we really want students to be independent, inquisitive, & persistent, then we need to provide them with the means to acquire these skills.       Group work and class norms  There is some evidence that the use of group roles, in which all group members rotate assigned tasks each day, improves student learning See e.g. Hauk, S., Speer, N. M., Kung, D., Tsay, J.-J., and Hsu, E. (Eds.) (2013). Video cases for college mathematics instructor professional development, currently accessible (as of 3-29-2022) at this link . Additionally, in a course that discusses sensitive political topics, my experience has emphasized the importance of agreeing on discussion norms before beginning a sensitive discussion. I hope the following activities help with establishing both of these sets of norms.   Ground rules  Given the nature of this course, it's important that we develop class norms to promote an atmosphere which will facilitate the learning process as well as respect the experiences of different groups in the classroom and the larger society. The class can agree to revise them and add others, but all students must commit themselves to the final set of rules by the end of the first class. These principles will guide our class discussions and interactions.  Setting group norms  Think-Pair-Share on what common norms for group work and discussion are important for our class.   Whose voices are valued?    What philosophy do we have about who can make contributions to mathematics and the value of those contributions?    How does this connect to the values we espouse for our democracy?      Here are some useful classroom norms:     Controversy and vulnerability : different views are expected and honored with a group commitment to understand the sources of disagreement and to work cooperatively toward common solutions without putting a disproportionate responsibility on marginalized groups to educate us .    No one's identities are under question: e.g. no arguing that queer people are wrong for existing.    Please come talk to your instructor anytime you feel uncomfortable enough that it's affecting your work in class.       Own your intentions and your impact. Acknowledge that the impact of your actions is not always congruent with your intentions and that positive or neutral intentions do not trump negative impact. Participate truthfully and accept when your actions or words harm others.     Challenge by choice : individuals may determine for themselves if and to what degree they will participate in a given discussion or activity. It is possible not to participate in a few activities and still receive an A in the course. Be aware of what factors influence your decision about whether to challenge yourself on a given issue.     Respect : each other and yourselves. Investigate how your cultural context affects what you think of as respect for others and acknowledge what respect looks like in other contexts.     No attacks . personal attacks are a form of extreme disrespect. Disagreeing with ideas is welcome; attacking individuals for their ideas is not.         (TPS) What does respect look like for you? How might ideas of respect vary with cultural context? How might you firmly challenge the views of someone else in a respectful manner?   What are the differences betweeen a personal attack and a challenge to an idea that makes an individual feel uncomfortable? What are some situations that might blur the lines between the two? How can we acknowledge when certain beliefs (e.g. trans people not existing) are inherently personal attacks?      Group roles   Group roles : In order to facilitate group interaction, you will take on group roles designed to mimic the role of mathematical and\/or sociological researchers. The roles are as follows:     The facilitator is responsible for making sure every student is able to contribute and be heard. Contributions may include asking good questions, rephrasing someone else's idea, coming up with a way of connecting mathematics to the real world, and many others.    the resource manager is responsible for obtaining and keeping track of all necessary resources to solve a problem. Resources may include writing utensils, paper, the Internet, your instructor, data sources, and most importantly, your team.    the lead author is responsible for writing down the ideas that each group comes up with.    the communicator is responsible for reporting what your group came up with to the class, instructor, and any relevant community groups.    Assign roles to each group by first letters of first name; they'll rotate every day of class. Anyone can answer questions posed to the whole class, but if your group came up with an idea that hasn't been shared yet, it someone in your group's responsibility to share your answer so that everyone can learn from you!

  "body": " Cui Bono: Who Benefits?     Hasan Minhaj on Student Loans  The comedian Hasan Minhaj, of the former Netflix weekly show Patriot Act, focused a popular episode of his show on student loans in the US. Amazingly, this led to an invitation to testify before Congress on September 10, 2019, on the student loan debt crisis. Please watch the above YouTube clip from Patriot Act (good closed captioning available on YouTube), then answer the following questions.  What are some of the consequences that are faced by people who can't pay off their student loans?  What happened in 2010 to change the landscape of student loan debt in the US?  What are loan servicers, and what has their role been in the student loan crisis? > What are three ways in which Navient has mistreated borrowers?  What is an income-based repayment plan? What is forbearance, and why has it negatively affected borrowers when Navient encourages borrowers to enter forbearance instead of income-based repayment?  In what ways does Minhaj argue that the Department of Education has failed borrowers?     The highest proportion of student loan debt (the amount of debt held per student) is held by students at for-profit colleges , which are colleges that are not funded by taxes but instead depend on federal student aid (guaranteed by the government) and the tuition dollars that students pay to attend, often backed up by federal student aid. Contrast this situation with the vast majority of colleges and universities in the U.S., which are nonprofit institutions, which are usually run by a not-for-profit institution, religious organization, or government and hence often receive funding from taxes or a particular religious group.  The greatest proportion of defaults (see ) on student debt in  occurred at the University of Phoenix, Walden University, Nova Southeastern University, Capella University, and Strayer University , of which all but Nova are for-profit.  Almost all students are eligible to receive federal student loans, which are student loans funded by the U.S. federal government through programs such as Pell Grants. Federal loans are either subsidized (that is, interest payments are covered by the federal government for a period including the student's time at a college or university ; such loans are restricted to undergraduates only) or unsubsidized (in which case borrowers must pay the interest).  In contrast, private student loans are loans offered by non-governmental companies which are heavily advertised, do not offer the relatively generous forbearance and deferred-payment options that federal loans do, and charge interest while the borrower is in college. Often, private student loan interest rates are higher even than those of unsubsidized federal student loans. Since many students do not have a credit history, federal student loans do not require proof of, or a co-signer attesting, creditworthiness , or evidence of past ability to repay debt; as of the s, most private student loans required such proof . Additionally, students who declare bankruptcy are unable to discharge private student loans, meaning borrowers who have no money are still required to pay private corporations back for student loans . Therefore, the U.S. government earns more income from student loans, but profits less, on average, than private student loan companies.  Employers benefit from the number of students who attend college, including those who could not otherwise attend without taking out student loans. Credentialism , the continuing growth in employers' expectations of postsecondary education on the part of their employees, has been called a key driver of student loan debt . In , earnings were stagnant for most workers, but declined rapidly for workers with no college education. This pressures people to seek a college education whether or not they can afford it.  Finally, a article in The Atlantic implies that middle-class college graduates were able to advance their cause over other causes championed by more marginalized groups because they have higher relative political power compared to non-college graduates. Certainly, as we will see in the next sections, middle-class college graduates benefit a great deal from President Biden's student debt cancellation policy.  "

  "body": " Big Problem: the Staggering and Inequitable Burden of U.S. Student Debt      Student loans are a form of debt taken on in order to help students afford to pay tuition, fees, and other expenses necessary to attend colleges and universities. Unlike scholarships or grants, student loans must be repaid.    In July , student loan debt in the U.S. totaled trillion. In , the average debt held by a student loan borrower was .      Defaulting on a loan means a borrower stops making the required payments on that loan. When someone defaults on a student loan, the federal government is allowed to withhold their tax refund, paycheck, or (for older adults) Social Security payments.     The average person to default on their student loans owes less than , suggesting that defaulters are make significantly lower incomes than the average student loan borrower. Those borrowers who did not complete a college degree are three times as likely to default as those who completed . Moreover, half of Black borrowers who took out loans in - had defaulted after years.     The Pell Grant is a federal government grant which provides money for college to low-income students that does not have to be repaid, unlike student loans.     Those who receive a Pell Grant, signaling they are low-income without adding to their debt, are still disproportionately likely to default on their student loans .     All public and most private colleges ( of all colleges in  are not-for-profit institutions , meaning they invest their profits back into the institution and often operate under independent governance. A college that is not registered as a not-for-profit institution is called a for-profit college .       A college or university operates under independent governance if their leadership is required to focus on factors other than generating a profit when providing an education .     A government study in found that the default rates for student borrowers at for-profit institutions, which are not required to focus on factors other than profit, were nearly double compared to community colleges; for-profit institutions have more expensive tuition and fees than community colleges, have lower graduation rates, and have less valuable credentials .      Tuition is the amount of money charged by a college for instruction by faculty.    A student fee is a sum of money charged to students at a school, college, or university in addition to tuition. Student fees may be used to support student organizations and activities, sports teams, exercise facilities, class supplies such as art materials, or anything else beyond the cost of instruction.     The United States is a relative outlier compared to other nations in the high cost of college tuition and fees. For example, according to a late study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. has the highest average tuition costs of the OECD member countries . This tuition has increased over time.  "

Does this table (and the supplement on the number of students in grad school) back up the suggestion of this Atlantic article  that the cause of increased student debt is that more students are taking out loans to enroll in grad school? Why or why not?      Use TuitionTracker to describe recent trends at your own institution in the same way. Is your college or university better or worse in amount of student debt than the average in the US? The average for institutions of the same type?   Compare the total amount paid in student debt for various racial groups using this table .    Does it seem like any racial groups are being disproportionately saddled with student loan debt? How can we compare, say, debt held by white vs. Asian students to see whether the difference is larger than we'd expect? Well, first we need to quantify the idea of “what we'd expect”...what does this mean? Create an expected frequency table for what you'd expect to see if there were absolutely no racial differences in student debt.    Compute the difference between the observed count for each race  and the expected count . What do you notice?    What if we averaged all the 's for each racial group? This is effectively the idea of a chi-squared test for goodness-of-fit , which is used by statisticians to determine whether any differences observed are small enough to be due to chance or large enough that they give evidence of a difference. What would the equation for this average look like?    We'll use a computer to perform this test in a minute. First, what groups do you think are disproportionately likely\/unlikely to hold student loan debt? What racial groups have a higher\/lower debt burden per person?    Now, enter this data into an app such as RStudio or an online tool. In RStudio, run this code to do a chi-squared test. (In a statistics class, walk through the steps.) Output the -value (the likelihood the observed differences are due to chance alone) and residuals , which are basically scaled versions of the s for each racial group. Which are highest? Lowest? Is there evidence of racial bias?       If these materials are being used for a course in, say, introductory statistics for STEM fields or a higher-level data science class, this is a good time to discuss linear regression with multiple predictors to formalize the effect of year and type of institution on tuition or race and year on student debt. However, since this text is primarily intended for courses without prerequisites targeted at majors and non-majors alike, such material is beyond the scope of this chapter.  "

  "title": "The Intersectional Inequities of Student Debt",
  "body": " The Intersectional Inequities of Student Debt   The average undergraduate student who takes out student loans has around in debt by the end of their higher education, according to the U.S. Department of Education. However, this debt is not spread equitably by demographic category: of non-Hispanic-identifying Black families carry an education loan, compared to of non-Hispanic white families and of Hispanic-identifying families .  Student debt is also not equally spread among age groups; Millennials (who were - years old in ) total over billion in student loan debt, compared to a little over million of Gen Z (under in ), a little under million held by those - years of age in , a bit under million held by those - years old, and only around million held by those or older in  .  Since Black families have been prevented from amassing generational wealth through systemic racism (in which laws favor one racial group over another), the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, and mass incarceration, as well as continued implicit and explicit racism in public policy, housing (including the legacy of redlining, a policy which conitnued through ), private banking and lending, access to education, and hiring practices, Black folks are both more likely to have to take on debt to attend college and less likely to attain wealth due to a college education .  In particular, a study found that the average white college-educated parent contributed to their children's education, while Black parents contributed on average. This is true despite the fact that, when controlling by household type and economic situation, Black parents contribute more on average than white parents.  Lower-income Black parents are disproportionately likely to take out Parent PLUS loans, which are loans provided by the U.S. Department of Education to the parents of college students. Parent PLUS loans are unsubsidized and charge a loan fee (added to each loan payment) of and an interest rate of as of  , adding a substantial financial burden to the parent borrower.  Under these circumstances, Black borrowers default on student loans five times more often that white borrowers . Therefore, the disproportionate load of student debt on Black borrowers is both a symptom of, and exacerbates, the racial wealth gap in the U.S., or the difference in total assets and debts between Black and white Americans.  Defaulting on federal student loan debt leads to consequences such as bad credit ratings, a decrease in tax refunds, the garnishment of wages, and removal of security clearances which are at times a condition of employment . The consequences for those who default include an inability to obtain loans to buy homes or cars, loss of wages, or loss of employment.   The Toll of Student Debt in the U.S.   The data in this section come partly from a New York Times article by Ella Koeze and Karl Russell entitled The Toll of Student Debt in the U.S. An archived version of the article can be accessed here .  What are three things you notice about the graphs shown in the article? Explain what these particular things mean for students with debt.  What are three things you wonder about based on the article that are not answered in the article itself?  Do some research online and find reputable sources to answer your questions above.      Trends in Student Aid   The following four questions are about the most recent College Board Trends in Student Aid  publication, which can be downloaded here .   Explain the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans. (You may have to use other online sources.)  When did the federal government begin giving unsubsidized loans to students according to the chart in Trends in Student Aid ? (You may also have to use other online sources.)  Since the year , describe the trend for both subsidized and unsubsidized loans.

Who is impacted by each part? What impacts would the plan have on each group?  Which do you feel is the most essential component of the plan? Why?  What is the current status of this debt relief plan? You may have to do additional research online. Has it been blocked by the courts? Changed by legislation? Implemented in full? Why or why not?  >    The Atlantic asks, “ Who Really Benefits From Student-Loan Forgiveness ?”  The article hints that student loan debt has received national attention because college graduates have significant political power. Do you believe that student debt forgiveness is a privileged position to advocate for? Why or why not?  Why might student debt exacerbate the racial wealth gap? Do you think it does?  Do you believe that canceling student debt helps shrink the racial wealth gap? Why or why not?  How could you use statistics to determine whether student loan debt was due to rising tuition\/fees, inflation, or as the article mentions, the number of recipients attending grad school? What do you believe?       According to a late 2017 study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , the U.S. has the greatest annual average tuition and fees of all surveyed countries charged to nationals of that country. Note that the symbols a in the table mean the category does not pply , while m means data are not available ( missing ).   What general trends (by continent, region, degree type, or type of institution) do you notice in the table? Explain.  What impact may the missing or not applicable data have on the general trends observed in the table? Explain.      Reading the News on Student Loans   Part of quantitative literacy is being able to critically interpret numbers and mathematics in the news media. To that end, find an article from the last four years involving student loans that makes at least 2-3 numerical claims. The College Board website or reputable news sources ( New York Times , Washington Post , Reuters, Associated Press, etc.) about government policy on student loans and loan forgiveness are good sources,; you're welcome to find your own sources as well. Take the number(s) in your article and do the following:   Decide what point the article is trying to make by citing these numbers.  Before pulling out an electronic device, brainstorm a list of questions (3-5) you'd like to know about the numbers–things that would help you understand if the numbers are big or small, and whether or not the underlying data actually supports the article's argument.  Get online and try to answer your questions.  Rate the article's claims on two scales:   How true is the statement? (0 = completely false, 4 = completely true)    How misleading is the statement? (0 = not at all, 4 = totally misleading) (In other words, when you look at the underlying data, does it support the article's point or not?)      "

  "body": " Solving for Change: Student Loan Reform & Activism in the U.S.  In August , President Biden committed to forgiving in student debt for around million debtors in the U.S., with an additional being forgiven for Pell Grant recipients. The debt was forgiven only for single adults earning under a year and married couples earning under a year .  Student debt in the U.S. in , when President Biden proposed his student loan debt forgiveness plan, was roughly equal to the size of the economy of Brazil . Additionally, the amount of funding for higher education provided by state governments has declined from around in the s to slightly under in .  An independent analysis by the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business found that about two-thirds of the financial benefit from Biden's student loan forgiveness plan will be to households making or less per year, especially households earning between and a year . The impact to the U.S. budget will be between and billion.  The Wharton School also released the data in on the distribution of student loan forgiveness benefits by income.   Student Debt Forgiven under the Biden-Harris Plan  Distribution of student loan forgiveness benefit by income under the Biden student loan forgiveness plan. Most of the debt forgiven would have accumulated for those in the - age group; hence, this column may be more representative of the plan's effects. No benefit is expected to go to the top of earners in either age group. Data from Wharton School of Business.     All Ages  Age -    Income Group  Percentage of benefit  Percentage of benefit    Bottom      st- th percentile      st- th percentile      st- th percentile      -      -        For each of the following questions, read the cited article, considering the listed questions. Then use what you've read, as well as your own thoughts, to make your best attempt at answering these questions. Finally, bring these attempts to class and discuss them with your group. Choose someone in your group to report your group's conclusions during full-class discussion.      This article by Mother Jones (known for being a left-leaning publication) investigates the history of the student loan debt forgiveness movement, beginning with the activism of Occupy Wall Street in (see ) and America's first debtors' union, the Debt Collective.  What does the article describe as the origin of the Debt Collective and the movement to cancel student debt from for-profit colleges?  Why did Gokey decide to focus on forming a debt collective?

For-profit colleges have defrauded students and led to an increase in student debt; this was a major concern of Occupy Wall Street activists and is described in the following 2014 Last Week Tonight video . In June , the federal Department of Education automatically canceled all debt currently held by Corinthian Colleges students and alumni .   What makes Corinthian and other for-profit colleges different from private nonprofit colleges or public universities?  Do you agree with the Department of Education's actions? Why or why not?  What should the Department of Education do with student loans held by other for-profit colleges, including those who were not as openly fraudulent as Corinthian (who paid companies to hire their students for two days in order to inflate their job placement numbers)?  What should the Department of Education do with student loans held by nonprofit colleges?       11 . Assume for a moment that these policies stay constant for the next years (perhaps an unlikely assumption given the changes in policy between Presidential administrations as well as Supreme Court rulings).    What percentage of the benefit will your age and income group receive years from now?    If you are in one of the groups (single adults earning under a year and married couples earning under a year, plus an additional for Pell Grant recipients) that President Biden targeted for debt forgiveness in , what amount of debt will you have forgiven?    Do you believe that President Biden's student loan debt forgiveness policy is a good idea? Why or why not? Do its benefits for lower-income debtors outweigh its impats on the U.S. budget? Estimate whether your taxes will rise as a result and, if so, by how much, using a well-explained dimensional analysis.    The following note from the Wharton Budget Model describes the income groups listed in : Estimate household income percentile thresholds for 2022 all age: 20%: $28,784; 40%: $50,795; 60%: $82,400; 80%: $141,096; 90% $212,209; 95%: $321,699; 99%: $961,711; 99.9%: $3,668,499.     Given this information, estimate the percentage of the student loan forgiveness plan your income group will receive.     The Congressional Budget Office , a nonpartisan organization within the legislative branch of the United States government, estimated the total cost of Biden's student loan forgiveness program at billion. Use this estimate, together with the information above, to estimate how much total debt relief (in U.S. dollars) your income and age group wlil receive years from now.      President Biden's loan forgiveness program involves an income cap , which means that the program only applies to individuals who earn below or households who earn below each year. According to the Wharton analysis shown in , whether or not an income cap is applied, the most loan forgiveness would go to households earning between and a year.    What income percentile(s) in do these earners belong to?    Assuming that the loan forgiveness policy stays constant for the next years, estimate the percentage of loan forgiveness that will apply to these income percentile(s). Make the simplifying assumption that all student loan borrowers are individuals and not households.    Does the Wharton estimate make sense? Why or why not?      "
