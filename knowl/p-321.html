<div class="para">Very few objects are perfect blackbodies.  However many are close enough in the sense that assuming blackbody radiation in calculations yeilds results that lend an accurate perspective. Of course the closer an object is to being a blackbody, the more acurate the calculations will be.  For our models we will need the relationship between the amount of radiation emitted by a blackbody and its temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law gives this relationship and states that the total energy, <span class="process-math">\(J \)</span> emitted per unit area per unit time by a blackbody is directly proportional to the fourth power of its temperature.  The units are terms joules per second per square meter and are denoted <span class="process-math">\(j/sm^2\)</span> .  So <span class="process-math">\(J \propto T^4 \)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(J =\sigma T^4  j/s m^2\)</span>   where <span class="process-math">\(\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \)</span> with units of <span class="process-math">\({W\,m^{-2}\,K^{-4}}  \)</span> is the Stefan-Boltzman constant. </div>
