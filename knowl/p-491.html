<div class="para">In the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Climate Accords, one of the main points of discussion was how much each nation should be asked to cut their emissions. Major emitters today, like China and India, argued that the burden of stopping greenhouse gas emissions should fall mainly on developed nations like the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European countries, because the CO2 that those nations emitted in the past has been and still is a major contributor to climate change. Those nations now enjoy a high quality of life at least in part because of the emissions which they made in the past, but many have substantially reduced their emissions already.  Emissions from Europe &amp; the United States account for 58% of total cumulative emissions since 1750, but only 30% of current emissions in 2019 <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/climate-change-biblio-co2-annual-data.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.11.1.29">[4.11.1.29]</a>.</div>
