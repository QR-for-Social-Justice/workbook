It would be ideal if each spot in the list was \"labeled\" with the corresponding letter.\n\nThe way we'll do this is by *merging* our `alphabet` list with `count_list`. This takes the first entries in each list, in this case `'A'` and `0`, and merges them together into the entry `['A',0]`.\n\nSimilarly, we'll get the entries \n\n```\n['B',0], ['C',0], ['D',0], ['E',1],\n```\n\netc.\n\nThe Python command to merge two lists together is `zip(list1, list2)`. **Below, write the command to merge the lists `alphabet` and `count_list` together, then name your \"zipped\" list `letter_freq`**.","pos":8,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bc13c8","input":"## Python Module: Frequency Analysis\n\nFrequency analysis is the process of counting the number of occurrences of ciphertext letters in order to make a guess about what plaintext letters they came from. Frequency analysis only works for *monoalphabetic substitution ciphers*, in which letters are always enciphered the same way (for example, every 'e' in the plaintext is enciphered as a 'T'). Frequency analysis breaks down (though it can be modified to work) in the case of *polyalphabetic substitution ciphers*, in which different occurences of a plaintext letter could be enciphered differently. (For example, one 'e' may be enciphered as a 'T' and another as an 'R'.)\n\nFor example: For the text \"TEST\" the frequency of 'E' is 1, 'S' is 1 and 'T' is 2. The input to the function will be an encrypted body of text that only contains the capital letters A-Z. As output, we will print a list of the frequency for each of the letters A-Z.\n\nTo begin, let's look at the code for a frequency count of the text \"TEST\".\n\nWe'll start with an empty `count_list`, then initialize the count at zero for each of the $26$ capital English letters. The following code chunk will (once you fix it) initialize the count of each letter as $0$. In other words, the code chunk will add $26$ zeroes to our list of letter counts. \n\nIt's much easier to use a `for` loop here rather than adding 26 zeroes to our list by hand. In other words, we want to tell our computer to \"append\" 0 to our `count_list` 26 times.\n\nDo you remember how to specify the range of numbers between 0 and 25, including 0 and 25? **Edit the chunk of code below to add the correct numerical range in between the parentheses after `range` in the line `for i in range():`**","pos":0,"type":"cell"}
