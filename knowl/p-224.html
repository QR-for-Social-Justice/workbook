<div class="para">The <em class="emphasis">Caesar cipher</em> is an example of a <em class="emphasis">monoalphabetic substitution cipher</em>, in which every character is replaced by some other character. It is the earliest known example of a substitution cipher and, according to the Roman historian Suetonius, was used by Julius Caesar himself. It is currently understood as encrypting messages by shifting every letter forward in the alphabet by <span class="process-math">\(3\text{;}\)</span> that is, as the function <span class="process-math">\(f(p)=p+3\mod26\text{.}\)</span> More generally, a <em class="emphasis">shift cipher</em> may shift every letter forward by any amount.</div>
