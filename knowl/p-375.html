<div class="para">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has built mathematical models - like the ones we studied in <a href="climate-change-math-topic-mathematical-models.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.7: Mathematical Models">SectionÂ 3.7</a>, but much more complicated - to predict how much global temperatures will rise in the future.  These models are referred to as Representative Concentration Pathways (RPC), because they represent how the concentration of CO<span class="process-math">\(_2\)</span> will change throughout the future <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/climate-change-biblio-rcp.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3.11.1.38">[3.11.1.38]</a>.  These models range from RCP2.6, in which humans manage to limit global warming to an average of 1.5 degrees Celsius, to RCP4.5 with an increase of 2.4 degrees celsius, RCP6.0 with an increase of 3 degrees, and RCP8.5, in which humans continue to increase emissions as we have been for centuries, with global warming on average of 4.9 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 (and more beyond that).</div>
