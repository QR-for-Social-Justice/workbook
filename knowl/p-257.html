<div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Ask students: from the work you just did, what multiplicative keys do you think “work” for affine ciphers? What is the “problem” with the keys that don’t work? Even if they don’t have a complete sense of the issue, have them explain their hypothesis. Prompt students to make multiplication tables modulo <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> for some reasonably small composite <span class="process-math">\(n\text{;}\)</span> ask them to compare what happens in rows which are relatively prime to <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> versus rows that aren’t. How might this connect to the issue with the affine cipher <span class="process-math">\(c\equiv13p+k\mod26\text{?}\)</span> What patterns do they notice or wonder about?</em></div>
