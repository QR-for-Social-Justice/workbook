    <title>Solving for Change: Student Loan Reform &amp; Activism in the U.S. </title>

    <p>
        In August <m>2022</m>, President Biden committed to forgiving <m>\$10,000</m> in student debt for around <m>43</m> million debtors in the U.S., with an additional <m>\$10,000</m> being forgiven for Pell Grant recipients. The debt was forgiven only for <url href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230301033830/https://globalnews.ca/news/9081983/biden-forgives-student-loans-americans/">single adults earning under <m>\$125,000</m> a year and married couples earning under <m>\$250,000</m> a year</url>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Student debt in the U.S. in <m>2022</m>, when President Biden proposed his student loan debt forgiveness plan, was <url href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230122063133/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/26/your-money/student-loan-forgiveness-debt.html">roughly equal to the size of the economy of Brazil</url>. Additionally, the amount of funding for higher education provided by state governments has declined from around <m>70\%</m> in the <m>1970</m>s to slightly under <m>60\%</m> in <m>2019</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        An independent analysis by the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business found that about two-thirds of the financial benefit from Biden's student loan forgiveness plan will be <url href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2022/8/26/biden-student-loan-forgiveness">to households making <m>\$88,000</m> or less per year, especially households earning between <m>\$51,000</m> and <m>\$82,000</m> a year</url>. The impact to the U.S. budget will be between <m>\$469</m> and <m>\$519</m> billion.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Wharton School also released the data in <xref ref="tab-debt-forgiven-by-income-age" /> on the distribution of student loan forgiveness benefits by income.

    <title>For-Profit Colleges and Department of Education Policy</title>
    <introduction>
        For-profit colleges have defrauded students and led to an increase in student debt; this was a major concern of Occupy Wall Street activists and is described in <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8pjd1QEA0c">the following 2014 Last Week Tonight video</url>. In June <m>2022</m>, the federal Department of Education <url href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/06/education-department-student-debt-cancellation-corinthian/">automatically canceled all debt currently held by Corinthian Colleges students and alumni</url>.

            Assume for a moment that the Biden-Harris policies you investigated in <xref ref="rqs-biden-plan" /> stay constant for the next <m>10</m> years (perhaps an unlikely assumption given the changes in policy between Presidential administrations as well as Supreme Court rulings).

            Do you believe that President Biden's student loan debt forgiveness policy is a good idea? Why or why not? Do its benefits for lower-income debtors outweigh its impats on the U.S. budget? Estimate whether your taxes will rise as a result and, if so, by how much, using a well-explained dimensional analysis.

            The following note from the Wharton Budget Model describes the income groups listed in <xref ref="tab-debt-forgiven-by-income-age" />: <q>Estimate household income percentile thresholds for 2022 all age: 20%: $28,784; 40%: $50,795; 60%: $82,400; 80%: $141,096; 90% $212,209; 95%: $321,699; 99%: $961,711; 99.9%: $3,668,499.</q>

            <url href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-09/58494-Student-Loans.pdf">The Congressional Budget Office</url>, a nonpartisan organization within the legislative branch of the United States government, estimated the total cost of Biden's student loan forgiveness program at <m>\$400</m> billion. Use this estimate, together with the information above, to estimate how much total debt relief (in U.S. dollars) your income and age group wlil receive <m>10</m> years from now.

            President Biden's loan forgiveness program involves an <q>income cap</q>, which means that the program only applies to individuals who earn below <m>\$125,000</m> or households who earn below <m>\$250,000</m> each year. According to the Wharton analysis shown in <xref ref="tab-debt-forgiven-by-income-age" />, whether or not an income cap is applied, the most loan forgiveness would go to households earning between <m>\$51,000</m> and <m>\$82,000</m> a year.

        <p><ol>

            Assuming that the loan forgiveness policy stays constant for the next <m>10</m> years, estimate the percentage of loan forgiveness that will apply to these income percentile(s). Make the simplifying assumption that all student loan borrowers are individuals and not households.
