<div class="para">This graph contains a lot of information - 3 different data sets (GDP, CO2 Emissions, and temperature change) for every country for every year from 1961-2014.  Looking at all of that data in a table could be overwhelming, but this visualization makes it easier to see certain patterns.  We can see that in general, as time changes, the nations of the world are getting richer (the points move right), producing more CO2 (the points move up), and hotter (the points get larger and more red).  We can also see that despite all these changes, inequality persists - some countries remain poor while others get even more wealthy.</div>
