<div class="para">The second reviewed question involved educating all students in a manner that promoted equity, justice, and a critical analysis of their sociopolitical contexts. In this direction, guidelines include: (1) working with a textbook with a strong mathematical framework and scaffolding, (2) talk to students to decide on equity/justice issues to cover, (3) set up units around “Essential Questions”, (4) introduce the equity/justice issue first, (5) then begin the mathematics, devoting as much time as necessary to the concepts and scaffolding both math and equity/justice along the way, (6) end with a great project. Some specific unit ideas: for exponents, studying compound interest and population growth; for probability, exploring the possibility that a traffic stop should be (and is) a person of color (Osler, 2007; Gutstein, 2008).</div>
