<div class="para">Note that the 2020 ACLU page was last updated on March 20, 2020, since many state legislatures were suspended or closed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic; the ACLU page promised to “update the tracker as major new developments occur[red] .” This data has distinct variable names and organization, so we also modify the ACLU data to match the Track Trans Legislation data as closely as possible.</div>
