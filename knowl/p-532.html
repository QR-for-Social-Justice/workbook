<div class="para">There is a lack of studies that investigate specific teaching practices which benefit African-American students, including teacher-student interaction and its effects. Although trying to specify “general” practices across a group as diverse as African-Americans in the US may lead to essentialization, a variety of historical conditions in the US have meant that almost all African-Americans have been told that they are inferior academically. Therefore, the studies this article calls for would benefit any group which is systemically marginalized in US mathematics education, including women and Latin@s. Across all the studies reviewed, it seems that providing African-American students with a common experience that grounds mathematical ideas, as well as explicitly encouraging and supporting African-American students to do more sophisticated mathematics, are important. Studies that focus on “successful” African-American learners provide an important counternarrative but also do not explicitly state what made those learners “successful”. The authors suggest that future studies investigate “(a) teachers’ orientations to teaching African-American students math, (b) forms of instructional practice that support African-American students to participate in rigorous mathematical activity, and (c) African-American students’ experiences as learners of mathematics”.</div>
