<div class="para">Unlike past changes to the climate, the current change is driven almost entirely by the actions of a single species - ours. As early as the 1820s, the French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier realized that the Earth's atmosphere must trap some of the sun's warmth - otherwise the Earth would be as cold as the moon <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/climate-change-biblio-history-global-warming.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3.11.1.16">[3.11.1.16]</a>. In 1859, the Irish physicist John Tyndall proved in a laboratory setting that certain gases - including water vapor (<span class="process-math">\(H_2O\)</span>), carbon dioxide (<span class="process-math">\(CO_2\)</span>), and methane (<span class="process-math">\(CH_4\)</span>) - were trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere.  In 1896, a Swedish physicist, Svante Arrhenius, who was studying carbon dioxide levels during the current time and during the last ice age, coined the term <em class="emphasis">greenhouse effect</em> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/climate-change-biblio-history-global-warming.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3.11.1.16">[3.11.1.16]</a>.</div>
