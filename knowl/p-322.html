<div class="para">The points of struggle mentioned above for students are worth reflecting on. These include multiple issues with learning to program for the first time: wading through confusing syntax errors, understanding the importance of whitespace in Python functions, and determining where to edit the preexisting code given to them. These issues can be somewhat ameliorated by walking through portions of Python modules as a whole class, breaking down the code underlying a function line by line to connect it to the more familiar steps of implementing a cipher by hand, and emphasizing that students are not expected to write their own code, only to change a word or two in the code provided for them. That said, students still tend to find Python, and programming, to be one of their least favorite aspects of what is generally a very fun course to teach and, per my students, to participate in. Other points of struggle include the extended Euclidean algorithm (due to the amount of symbolic manipulation involved), the complexity of the Enigma machineâ€™s components, and more generally the concept of modular arithmetic (though students usually gain understanding quickly by way of the clock metaphor). Feedback is welcome on any of the material above. Cryptography is very fun, yet it provides a window for first-year students into material not usually taught until a first course in abstract algebra, as well as motivation for more experienced students to learn number theory.</div>
