<div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Finally, it is recommended to assign one unsolved cipher such as that used in Part <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> of the Kryptos sculpture <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "bauerJamesSanbornKryptos2016" missing or not unique]</code>. Pass on (unattributed) to the students the hints that artist Jim Sanborn gave: the ciphertext letters NYPVTT decrypt to BERLIN, and the word immediately following BERLIN is CLOCK. Then, give students time in groups to attempt to solve all three ciphers. Usually many students solve the shift cipher, a good handful (with my assistance) solve the keyword cipher, and generally these students move onto Kryptos, notice it’s not monoalphabetic since (by the hints) <span class="process-math">\(i,n\mapsto T\text{,}\)</span> get frustrated, wonder about spacing, and come to a loss. At this stage one may tell them something like, “this is an unsolved cipher known as Kryptos Part <span class="process-math">\(4\text{;}\)</span> solve it and you’ll be famous!”</em></div>
