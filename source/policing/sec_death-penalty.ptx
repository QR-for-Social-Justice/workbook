			Students perform a Chi-square independence test and interpret the results in context understanding how examining the data in different ways can lead to new insights.

			<title>Introduction</title>

			<p>
				When we are interested in determining if there is an association between two categorical variables we have learned how to use a Chi-square test for independence. In this application, we look at the death penalty and potential association with race.

			<p>
				Presumably, you have already created a new project and downloaded this file into it. From the <c>Run</c> menu above, select <c>Run All</c> to run all existing code chunks.
			</p>

			<p>
				When prompted to complete an exercise or demonstrate skills, you will see the following lines in the document:
			</p>

			<p>
				These lines demarcate the region of the R Markdown document in which you are to show your work.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sometimes you will be asked to add your own R code. That will appear in this document as a code chunk with a request for you to add your own code, like so:
			</p>

			<pre># Add code here</pre>

			<p>
				Be sure to remove the line <c># Add code here</c> when you have added your own code. You should run each new code chunk you create by clicking on the dark green arrow in the upper-right corner of the code chunk.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sometimes you will be asked to type up your thoughts. That will appear in the document with the words, <q>Please write up your answer here.</q> Be sure to remove the line <q>Please write up your answer here</q> when you have written up your answer. In these areas of the assignment, please use contextually meaningful full sentences/paragraphs (unless otherwise indicated) and proper spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc. This is not R code, but rather a free response section where you talk about your analysis and conclusions. You may need to use inline R code in these sections.
			</p>

			<p>
				When you are finished with the assignment, knit to PDF and proofread the PDF file <term>carefully</term>. Do not download the PDF file from the PDF viewer; rather, you should export the PDF file to your computer by selecting the check box next to the PDF file in the Files plane, clicking the <c>More</c> menu, and then clicking <c>Export</c>. Submit your assignment according to your professor’s instructions.

			<title>The Data</title>

			<p>
				Between 1967 and 1977 there was a moratorium on the death penalty in the U.S. A main reason for this was the belief that there was racial bias in the application of the death penalty. When the racial bias argument was tested in court, defenders of the death penalty produced a contingency table for black and white defendants convicted of a capital crime in one state.
			</p>

			<p>
				The code below recreates the dataset documenting the outcome of 326 capital convictions, the race of the defendant, and the race of the victim. Don’t worry too much about this code.
			</p>

			<pre>penalty &lt;- c(rep(1,30), rep(0,184), rep(1,6), rep(0,106))
penalty &lt;- factor(penalty, levels = c(1, 0), labels = c("Death", "Not"))
victim_race &lt;- c(rep(0,214), rep(1,112))
victim_race &lt;- factor(victim_race, levels = c(1, 0), labels = c("Black", "White"))
defendant_race &lt;- c(rep(1,11), rep(0,19), rep(1,52), rep(0,132), rep(1,6), rep(1,97),rep(0,9))
defendant_race &lt;- factor(defendant_race, levels = c(1, 0), labels = c("Black", "White"))
DPenalty &lt;- data.frame(penalty, defendant_race, victim_race)</pre>

			<p>
				What follows is a fully-worked example of inference for independence of two categorical variables. After this first example you will complete a related inference test following the rubric of inference.

			<title>Research question</title>

			<p>
				Is there a relationship between the race of the defendant and whether or not the defendant received the death penalty or are race of the defendent and the application of the death penalty independent?

			<title>Your turn</title>

			<p>
				While you might feel comfortable with your analysis of the data as given in the contingency table above, that might not be sufficient to be confident that death penalty decisions are free of all racial bias given that the issue is much more complex than can be captured in one contingency table with two variables. It turns out that when one examines the race of the victims of these crimes rather than the race of the defendants we see some interesting results.
			</p>

			<p>
				Perform the hypothesis test to determine if there is a relationship between the race of the VICTIM and whether or not the defendant received the death penalty or are race of the VICTIM and the application of the death penalty independent?
