<div class="para">In contrast to the above article, a series of conjectured forms of instructional practice that would support African-American students (and all marginalized students) is given, and many of them are congruent with scientifically studied pedagogical recommendations, although few have been tested under controlled conditions. In the absence of scholarship testing specific practices, it seems the SoTL community is currently limited to such suggestions. The article suggests that, in a context of worsening oppression for low-income and people of color in the US, a failure to address social and economic justice in all areas of education is actively harmful for future generations. Drawing on ideas of Bob Moses (founder of the Algebra Project) and Paulo Freire, Osler delineates two components of “social justice mathematics”: math literacy as a civil right/social justice issue, and studying issues of social justice in the math classroom. Osler suggests that the use of such practices would not only give students a concrete connection to the mathematics they were learning, it would allow students to engage in higher-level mathematical thinking. Osler’s guidelines include: (1) working with a textbook with a strong mathematical framework and scaffolding, (2) talk to students to decide on social justice issues to cover, (3) set up units around “Essential Questions”, (4) introduce the social justice issue first, (5) then begin the mathematics, devoting as much time as necessary to the concepts and scaffolding both math and social justice along the way, (6) end with a great project. Some specific unit ideas: for exponents, studying compound interest and population growth; for probability, exploring the possibility that a traffic stop should be (and is) a person of color.</div>
