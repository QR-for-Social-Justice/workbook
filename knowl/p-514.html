<div class="para">In this section of their book <em class="emphasis">Rethinking Mathematics</em>, Gutstein and Peterson argue that a social justice approach to mathematics benefits students by allowing them to recognize the importance of mathematics as an essential tool for understanding and potentially changing the world. Other benefits of this philosophy, according to the authors, include educating students about social issues, connecting mathematics with students’ cultural and community histories, increasing student participation in democracy, and increasing student motivation. No studies are cited to support these assertions, but anecdotal evidence is used throughout the book to justify them. The authors advise teachers to get to know their students and communities and to use the issues students bring up as springboards for math lessons. This fits with the idea, brought up in class, that students come in to a classroom with their own schemas for understanding the world, and that meeting the students where they are is the best educational philosophy. The authors point out that disadvantaged communities, those who are currently the target of outreach to improve retention and performance in math courses, are the ones whose experiences are privileged under this style of teaching, and thus that they may be more likely to learn math in a justice framework. Gutstein and Peterson argue that teaching math in a “neutral” way is not possible, because even trying to leave politics out of the classroom is a political decision that prevents questioning of the status quo.</div>
