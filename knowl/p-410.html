<div class="para">Our data set for this example will consist of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of how wealthy a country is, and CO2 emissions.  Both of these numbers will naturally be larger for larger countries, because more people will produce more wealth and more CO2, so we consider the <em class="emphasis">per capita</em> numbers, meaning the amount of money or CO2 per person.  We can get these numbers by taking the total amount and dividing by the population of the country.  If you already know that there is a relationship between data sets because of something like population, dividing out by the value is an easy way to eliminate that relationship.  This is called <em class="emphasis">normalizing</em> the data set.</div>
