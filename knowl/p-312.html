<div class="para">What is really needed is a mathematical process that works more like padlocks than socks and shoes. In other words, we want to be able to have Alice and Bob each add their locks, then take them off in the opposite order in order to decrypt the message. And we want to do this without it being possible for anyone who intercepts the message to decrypt it! We want a <em class="emphasis">trapdoor one-way function</em> (easy to encrypt, hard to decrypt without the key) in which <em class="emphasis">encryption with two keys</em> is the same as decryption. A one-way function that arose in the affine cipher is multiplication mod <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> - finding inverses is hard!</div>
