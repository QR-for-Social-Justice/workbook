<div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Follow up by letting them know that we are not trying to be cruel, then ask them why we would give them an unsolved code. Based on our conversation, one may follow up with statements like, “What do you think mathematicians spend most of their time doing? How do you define “success” when working on an unsolved problem?” We emphasize that making sense of a problem, increasing their depth of understanding (what methods DON’T work?), describing their process of engagement, and even failing are all completely normal aspects of doing mathematics. Even problems that are solved often took years or even millennia to solve; therefore, there is no shame or cause for alarm if they don’t understand something immediately. This helps ground students as we move onto more and more abstract and difficult mathematics.</em></div>
