<li><div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Take three or four English texts of at least a couple of pages in length (books in the public domain, found online, are a good source of plaintext here). Encrypt these using shifts chosen however you like, then have students use their Python program, or one of the many available frequency analysis applets online, to determine the shifts used to encrypt each message. For additional practice, have them decrypt the first sentence and verify their guessed shift is correct. <em class="emphasis">Note</em>: some texts, especially shorter ones, will require students to guess multiple shifts and test each to see which gives legible plaintext, which verifies that their guess was correct.</em></div></li>
