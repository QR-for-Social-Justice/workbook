</h4> <div class="para">Data which can be represented numerically is called quantitative data.  This includes both data which is already numerical, and data which can be made numerical.  Dates are a good example of quantitative data that isn't always written in numbers (for example, "March" doesn't seem numerical, but can be represented by 3 since it is the 3rd month of the year).</div> <div class="para">Quantitative data naturally falls into one of two types - <em class="emphasis">discrete</em> and <em class="emphasis">continuous</em>.  While there are more complicated ways to distinguish between them mathematically, for our purpose the big difference is that with quantitative discrete data we have a small number of distinct possible responses, while with quantitative continuous data we have a large number of different possible responses.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="climate-change-math-topic-data-visualization.html#definition-12" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
