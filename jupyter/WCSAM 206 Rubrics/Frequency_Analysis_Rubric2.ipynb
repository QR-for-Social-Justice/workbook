    "## Python Module: Frequency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frequency analysis** is the process of counting the number of occurrences of ciphertext letters in order to make a guess about what plaintext letters they came from. Frequency analysis only works for *monoalphabetic substitution ciphers*, in which letters are always enciphered the same way (for example, every 'e' in the plaintext is enciphered as a 'T'). Frequency analysis breaks down (though it can be modified to work) in the case of *polyalphabetic substitution ciphers*, in which different occurences of a plaintext letter could be enciphered differently. (For example, one 'e' may be enciphered as a 'T' and another as an 'R'.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: For the text \"TEST\" the frequency of 'E' is 1, 'S' is 1 and 'T' is 2. The input to the function will be a ciphertext message that only contains the capital letters A-Z. As output, we will print a list of the frequency for each of the letters A-Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, let's look at the code for a frequency count of the text \"TEST\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with an empty `count_list`, then initialize the count at zero for each of the $26$ capital English letters. The following code chunk will (once you fix it) initialize the count of each letter as $0$. In other words, the code chunk will add $26$ zeroes to our list of letter counts. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's much easier to use a `for` loop here rather than adding 26 zeroes to our list by hand. In other words, we want to tell our computer to \"append\" 0 onto the end of our `count_list` 26 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why can't we just use `+=` for this? We can, but Python is a bit finicky about how it treats lists of numbers. If we wrote `count_list += 0`, we'd get an error (try it below if you'd like). This is because `+=` can only add *lists* to other lists, while `.append` can add numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our `count_list` is made up of numbers, we'll have to use the command `count_list.append(0)`. To append any number `n` to a list (call it my_list), the same idea works: we'd write `my_list.append(n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you remember how to specify the range of numbers between 0 and 25, including 0 and 25? **Edit the chunk of code below to add the correct numerical range in between the parentheses in the line \"`for i in range():`\"**"
