<div class="para">Critical pedagogy is pedagogy that aims to raise questions about "the way things are" and how things might be done differently with an eye toward equality and justice. Three domains related to critical mathematics education are surveyed: ethnomathematics, equity in mathematics education, and culturally responsive teaching. Ethnomathematics emphasizes the ways various cultures have done and do mathematics; culturally responsive teaching is defined as "using the cultural characteristics, experiences, and perspectives of ethnically diverse students as conduits for teaching them more effectively"; and equity in mathematics education is the creation of an educational environment in which all groups enjoy equal opportunities and equitable treatment.</div>
