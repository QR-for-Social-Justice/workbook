<div class="para"><em class="emphasis">At this point, it is useful for students to make themselves a “cheat sheet” which tells them the multiplicative inverse of any number mod 26, if it exists. (My expectation is not that they memorize such a list, though more power to them if they’d like to!) At this point, the most likely strategy students will use to find <span class="process-math">\(m^{-1}\mod26\)</span> is trial and error: multiplying each <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> by various integers mod <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> until they end up with <span class="process-math">\(1\mod26\text{.}\)</span> The number they multiplied by to get <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> is their <span class="process-math">\(m^{-1}\text{,}\)</span> if such a number exists. Ask: what relationship between <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and the modulus <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> predicts whether <span class="process-math">\(m^{-1}\)</span> exists?</em></div>
