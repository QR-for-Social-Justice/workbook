<div class="para">Inform students that there is a faster way to decrypt shift ciphers than saying the alphabet backwards in their heads. Ask them to try decrypting a message that was encrypted with a very large forward shift such as <span class="process-math">\(+25\text{.}\)</span> How would they do it? Likely by shifting each letter <em class="emphasis">forwards</em> by <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> to obtain the plaintext message. This means that in the English alphabet, <span class="process-math">\(0=25+1=26\text{,}\)</span> and now you can introduce modular arithmetic (working with modulus <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> for the foreseeable future). Itâ€™s beneficial to provide students with a <em class="emphasis">letter-to-number correspondence sheet</em>, which numbers English letters in increasing order starting with <span class="process-math">\(a=0\text{.}\)</span>
