<div class="para">At this point in the project, one may introduce the Vigenère cipher and its primary tools for cryptanalysis, the Kasiski and Friedman tests. This leads naturally to asking what happens when a Vigenère keyword is as long as the message it’s used to encrypt, whence students can prove to themselves that such a cipher (a <em class="emphasis">one-time pad</em>) is theoretically unbreakable by showing that different keywords lead to intelligible, but different, plaintext messages. The <em class="emphasis">Enigma machine</em> is then introduced as a “portable one-time pad generator,” providing an opportunity to tie the course to the more recent history of World War II.</div>
