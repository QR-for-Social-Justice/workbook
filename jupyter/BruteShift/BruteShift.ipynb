    "\n",
    "With shift ciphers and some other simple types of ciphers, the answer is yes! This is a good reason that the shift cipher is not currently used for military purposes. It was all well and good for Julius Caesar when no one was aware that shift ciphers existed, but now that they're commonly known, any shift-ciphered message could be broken by a (not particularly bright) computer in a few seconds.\n",

    "Breaking a cipher by **brute force** (or a **brute-force attack**) means trying to decrypt a message using all possible keys until you find a key that generates reasonable English plaintext. \n",

    "Let's start with a specific example. Say you encounter the ciphertext \"PBVHFUHW\", and you know it's been encrypted using a shift cipher (with unknown key). How would you execute a brute-force attack on this message with pen and paper? In the text box below, write out the steps you would take. How many possible keys would we have to try to decrypt a message that has been enciphered using an unknown shift cipher? Why?"
