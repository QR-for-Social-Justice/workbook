<li><p>Name/pronouns/PhD from Rice, research in how hard it is to untie
mathematical knots</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Please feel welcome to talk to me about my research at any time
during the semester if you're interested.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>My primary goal in teaching math is to communicate that math is a
creative, logical field with immense importance to society. which is
like a prosthetic you attach to your reasoning to make it more
powerful.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2

<h3 id="about-the-class">About the class</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>In this class, my goal is to get you to stretch your minds by
working in groups on problems that are hard for you. You won't be graded
on how quickly you pick things up or whether you understand every
detail, as long as you develop certain skills that allow you to do math
that is pertinent to your lives.</p></li>
<li><p>In this course, we'll often follow the following outline:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>ask a question or questions related to an issue of social justice
(e.g. are people of color more often exposed to hazardous pollutants
than white people?)</p></li>
<li><p>delve into some mathematics that will help us answer that
question (e.g. measures of exposure to pollutants, measures of
closeness, measures of “how PoC-dominant” a county is)</p></li>
<li><p>model the social justice question with a mathematical
question;</p></li>
<li><p>use the mathematics we've learned to answer the mathematical
question and interpret the answer in terms of the social justice
question.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In the syllabus, you'll find information on how to study math,
learning outcomes, textbooks, office hours, and extra credit
opportunities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="office-and-office-hours">Office and office hours</h3>

<li><p>My office is Foster 311 (go up the stairs to the third floor,
turn right; I'm at the end of the hall.)</p></li>
<li><p>My office hours this semester will be MW 1-2pm; TTH 11am-12pm.
Anyone who can't make those hours? I'll usually be around the office
1-4pm MW, 10am-1pm TTh, and (maybe) 11-noon Friday as well. Make
appointments at least <span class="math inline">24</span> hours in
advance!</p></li>

<h2 id="what-is-social-justice">What is social justice?</h2>
<div class="xca">
<p><strong> 1</strong>. (TPS) What do you think of when you think of
social justice? What are 2-3 issues of SJ you're passionate about?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some possible answers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>justice in terms of the distribution of wealth, opportunities,
and privileges within a society. (Google Dictionary)</p></li>
<li><p>a concept of fair and just relations between the individual and
society. (Wikipedia)</p></li>
<li><p>a state or doctrine of egalitarianism (Merriam-Webster)</p></li>
<li><p>A broad term for action intended to create genuine equality,
fairness and respect among peoples. (University of Massachusetts Lowell
Department of Multicultural Affairs)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Can we develop a working definition as a class?</p></li>
<li><p>One definition (Sensoy-DiAngelo): social justice is a recognition
that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>all people are individuals, but we are also members of socially
constructed groups;</p></li>
<li><p>society is stratified, and social groups are valued
unequally;</p></li>
<li><p>social groups that are valued more highly have greater access to
resources and this access is structured into the institutions and
cultural norms;</p></li>
<li><p>social injustice is real and exists today;</p></li>
<li><p>relations of unequal power are constantly being enacted at both
the micro (individual) and macro (structural) levels;</p></li>
<li><p>we are all socialized to be complicit in these
relations;</p></li>
<li><p>those who claim to be for social justice must strategically act
from that claim in ways that challenge social injustice; and</p></li>
<li><p>this action requires a commitment to an ongoing and lifelong
process.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How is this similar to and different from your definitions? The
UN's definition? Thomas Jefferson's?</p></li>

groups)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Let's agree to use classrooms as a measure of wealth, here used
as synonymous with net worth, for today's purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>For reference, the sum of all US wealth owned by households at
the end of <span class="math inline">2016</span> was <span
class="math inline">$90.2</span> trillionthat's <span
class="math inline">90, 200, 000, 000</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="xca">
<p><strong> 2</strong>. Assume the total US household wealth was held
entirely in <span class="math inline">$100</span> bills.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How many classrooms would it take to fit the US household wealth?
There's a lot to estimate here. Be systematic and consider reasonable
estimations. DO NOT guess some dimensions and dispense of the problem in
<span class="math inline">2</span> min - this is primetime for debate
within your group.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>wealth <span class="math inline"><em>W</em> ≈ $113</span>
trillion <span
class="math inline"> ≈ $110, 000, 000, 000</span></p></li>
<li><p>measure dim</p></li>
<li><p>guess <span class="math inline">20 × 30 × 10</span> feet</p></li>
<li><p>guess a <span class="math inline">$100</span> bill is flat and
<span class="math inline">6 × 4</span> in or <span
class="math inline">$\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{3}$</span> feet</p></li>
<li><p>The volume of the classroom is <span
class="math display"><em>V</em> = 20 × 30 × 10 = 6000
ft<sup>3</sup>.</span></p></li>
<li><p>We need <span
class="math display">$$\frac{W}{100}=\$1,100,000,000\approx1\text{
billion}$$</span> $100 bills to hold the total US household
wealth.</p></li>
<li><p>If we filled one classroom with <span
class="math inline">$100</span> bills, how many could we fit on the
floor? Well, each is <span
class="math inline">$\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{3}$</span>, and assuming
we place them with the long side toward the long side of the classroom,
we can fit <span class="math inline">$30/(\frac{1}{2})=60$</span> dollar
bill-lengths on the long side of the classroom
<span>[</span>draw?<span>]</span> and <span
class="math inline">$20/(\frac{1}{3})=60$</span> dollar bill-widths in
the classroom. That's <span class="math display">60 × 60 = 360</span>
hundred-dollar bills just on the floor. But the classroom is <span
class="math inline">10</span> ft high, so we can actually fit <span
class="math display">60 × 60 × 10 = 3600</span> dollar bills in a
classroom.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to fit about <span class="math inline">1</span> billion
dollar bills total in our classrooms. That is, we want to convert dollar
bills to classrooms. But dimensional analysis from chemistry gives us a
tool: <span class="math display">$$1,000,000,000\text{ dollar
bills}\times\frac{1\text{ classroom}}{3600\text{
bills}}\approx280,000\text{ classrooms}.$$</span></p></li>
<li><p>This is a tool we'll use in the coming weeks! In fact, we can use
canceling numerators and denominators to plan our entire computation:
<span class="math display">$$W=\$110,000,000,000\times\frac{1\text{
\$100 bill}}{\$100}\times\frac{1\text{ classroom}}{3600\text{ \$100
bills}}\approx310,000\text{ classrooms}$$</span> which matches our
result up to the rounding error introduced as we simplified the
calculation by rounding.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>How many of those classrooms do you think should go to the
wealthiest <span class="math inline">1%</span>? To the least wealthy
<span class="math inline">90%</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>In <span class="math inline">2016</span>, how many of those
classrooms actually went to the top <span class="math inline">1%</span>
and how many to the bottom <span class="math inline">90%</span>? For
reference, the top <span class="math inline">1%</span> got <span
class="math inline">40%</span> of the wealth in <span
class="math inline">2016</span> and the bottom <span
class="math inline">90%</span> got <span
class="math inline">22%</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Interesting question: how do we measure “how unequal”
incomes/wealth are in a country? Lorenz curves plot the percentile of
people on the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>-axis and the
percentage of wealth they got on the <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>-axis. So the numbers above say
that the points <span class="math display">(99%,40%) and
(10%,22%)</span> are on the Lorenz curve. This is because the top <span
class="math inline">1%</span> fall in the <span
class="math inline">99</span>th percentile, since <span
class="math inline">99%</span> of people earn less than them.</p></li>
<li><p>The top <span class="math inline">1%</span> got <span
class="math display">$$40\%(W)=0.4W\times\frac{1}{\$100}\times\frac{1}{3600}\approx120,000\text{
classrooms}$$</span> while the bottom <span
class="math inline">90%</span> got <span
class="math display">$$22\%(W)=0.22W\times\frac{1}{\$100}\times\frac{1}{3600}\approx67,000\text{
classrooms}.$$</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>What questions about wealth does this activity bring up for you?
I can think of a few:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How did you determine how many <span
class="math inline">$100</span> bills it would take to contain the US
household wealth?</p></li>
<li><p>How did you determine how many <span
class="math inline">$100</span> bills a classroom could hold?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we measure wealth <em>inequality</em> in a
country?</p></li>
<li><p>What assumptions are we making about an ideal society?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>We just demonstrated a couple of tools we'll use many times in
the next week or two:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Estimation</strong>round up or down to make calculations
easier and numbers less messy. As we saw when estimating the number of
classrooms needed for the US household wealth, rounding before the
computation ends can introduce error. Therefore, if you have a
calculator, it's best to plug into the calculator before rounding,
whereas if you're computing by hand, rounding may be necessary in order
to increase the accuracy of your computations. Everyone makes arithmetic
mistakesyou'll see me do it plenty of times!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimensional analysis</strong>: start with the given and
multiply by fractions, canceling out the units, until you get something
in the units your answer should be in. This is almost always your
answer!</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="setting-the-stage">Setting the Stage</h1>
<p>Get in groups of size 3. Group members should introduce themselves -
name, pronouns, hobbies outside school, goals for the semester/year,
reason they're taking the course. For each of the questions that follow,
I will ask you to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Think about a possible answer on your own.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss your answers with the rest of your group.</p></li>
<li><p>Share a summary of each group's discussion.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>What are the goals of a liberal arts education? How does social
justice fit in? How does math?</p></li>
<li><p>How does a person learn something new?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the value of making mistakes in the learning
process?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we create a safe environment where risk taking is
encouraged and productive failure is valued?</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>I will be teaching this course using IBL methods for all the
reasons you gave, as well as because research shows IBL improves student
understanding of mathematics more than traditional lecture-based
teaching methods.</p></li>

<p><em> 3</em>. An education must prepare a student to ask and explore
questions in contexts that do not yet exist. That is, we need
individuals capable of tackling problems they have never encountered and
to ask questions no one has yet thought of.</p>
<p>If we really want students to be independent, inquisitive, &amp;
persistent, then we need to provide them with the means to acquire these
skills.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="engagement-points-extra-credit-opportunities">Engagement Points
(Extra Credit Opportunities)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The Westminster College Department of Mathematics values the
experiences that students have with mathematics and data science outside
of the formal classroom. In order to encourage our students to find new
and interesting ways to engage with our disciplines, we have
incorporated a department-wide extra credit policy in which
extracurricular activities gain you engagement points which will
contribute toward your course grades..</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of activities that are likely to qualify include, but
are not limited to: attending office hours three times; attending a
meeting of the S-Cubed seminar; volunteering in the East High or
Cottonwood Tutoring Programs; attending Lemma social activities or
meetings; attending college Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
programming; taking the Putnam exam; attending a screening of a film
with mathematical themes; participating in a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) during the summer; attending a non-required
math-related talk or seminar; attending a regional/national math
conference; giving a talk related to math; submitting or publishing a
paper in an academic journal; participating in a math competition;
reading a book with mathematical themes; and many others.</p></li>
<li><p>If you participated in an activity that you think qualifies for
engagement points, please fill out the Google Form located at
tinyurl.com/WMengagement. Because we are unable to constantly check the
form responses, please contact me to determine whether you were granted
engagement points for your activity.</p></li>
<li><p>In this course, you may use three engagement points at any time
to get a free Pass on a reading response or five engagement points to
get a free Pass on a news response. I reserve the right to limit how
many times you may redeem engagement points in these ways. Please send
me an email or tell me in person if you'd like to use your engagement
points.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tutoring-programs">Tutoring Programs</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>You may earn engagement points by volunteering your time in
Westminster's Cottonwood High or East High Tutoring Programs. This
involves volunteering at least three times to work at an
after-school-tutoring lab at one of the two high schools with which
Westminster has a partnership. There, you would help high school
students struggling with mathematics. The high-school students receiving
this tutoring are usually in Algebra I, Geometry, or Algebra II and see
mathematics as confusing and frustrating. Both Programs are looking for
a willingness to help remove this fear from a scary subject in their
tutors.</p></li>
<li><p>Students who tutor or TA at least three times in the Cottonwood
tutoring program will receive a stipend of <span
class="math inline">$8</span> for every hour spent tutoring, as well as
one engagement point per hour volunteered.} Please see
tinyurl.com/sherlockclub for further details and to sign up for
Cottonwood tutoring or teaching assistantship.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="group-work-and-class-norms">Group work and class norms</h1>
<h2 id="ground-rules">Ground rules</h2>
<p>Given the nature of this course, it's important that we develop class
norms to promote an atmosphere which will facilitate the learning
process as well as respect the experiences of different groups in the
classroom and the larger society. The class can agree to revise them and
add others, but all students must commit themselves to the final set of
rules by the end of the first class. These principles will guide our
class discussions and interactions.</p>
<div class="xca">
<p><strong> 4</strong>. TPS on what common norms for group work and
discussion are important for our class.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Whose voices are valued?</p></li>
<li><p>What philosophy do we have about who can make contributions to
mathematics and the value of those contributions?</p></li>
<li><p>How does this connect to the values we espouse for our
democracy?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here are some useful classroom norms:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Controversy and vulnerability</strong>: different views
are expected and honored with a group commitment to understand the
sources of disagreement and to work cooperatively toward common
solutions <strong>without putting a disproportionate responsibility on
marginalized groups to educate us</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No one's identities are under question: e.g. no arguing that
queer people are wrong for existing.</p></li>
<li><p>Please come talk to me anytime you feel uncomfortable enough that
it's affecting your work in class.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Own your intentions and your impact.</strong> Acknowledge
that the impact of your actions is not always congruent with your
intentions and that positive or neutral intentions do not trump negative
impact. Participate truthfully and accept when your actions or words
harm others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenge by choice</strong>: individuals may determine
for themselves if and to what degree they will participate in a given
discussion or activity. It is possible not to participate in a few
activities and still receive an A in the course. Be aware of what
factors influence your decision about whether to challenge yourself on a
given issue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Respect</strong>: each other and yourselves. Investigate
how your cultural context affects what you think of as respect for
others and acknowledge what respect looks like in other contexts.</p>
<div class="xca">
<p><strong> 5</strong>. (TPS) What does respect look like for you? How
might ideas of respect vary with cultural context? How might you firmly
challenge the views of someone else in a respectful manner?</p>
</div></li>
<li><p><strong>No attacks</strong>. personal attacks are a form of
extreme disrespect. Disagreeing with ideas is welcome; attacking
individuals for their ideas is not.</p>
<div class="xca">
<p><strong> 6</strong>. What are the differences betweeen a personal
attack and a challenge to an idea that makes an individual feel
uncomfortable? What are some situations that might blur the lines
between the two? How can we acknowledge when certain beliefs (e.g. trans
people not existing) are inherently personal attacks?</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Group roles: In order to facilitate group interaction, you will
take on group roles designed to mimic the role of mathematical and/or
sociological researchers. The roles are as follows <strong>(follow along
in your syllabus)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The facilitator</strong> is responsible for making sure
