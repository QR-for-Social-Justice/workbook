		<title>Sea Level Change and Function Composition</title>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			Although most carbon dioxide emissions have been produced by wealthier industrial societies, it is poorer nations which will be impacted first and worst by any resulting change in climate. This is environmental injustice on an international scale.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			One example of this is the dramatic impact sea level rise is expected to have on subsistence fisher-folk living on low lying islands. In this module, you’ll work with a linear function and a quadratic function representing the sea level rise in the Republic of Maldives and create a simplified model of the geography of the Maldives (a triangular prism) to study the effects of sea-level rise in the region.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			After you compute the geographical effects of sea-level rise, you’ll research and write about how this impacts livelihoods and society in the Maldives and similar island nations.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Since the beginning of the industrial age, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere has been increasing [19]. The most common greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO2).
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Sea-level rise is already affecting the coastline of the United States, with significant impacts projected later in the century for major cities such as New York and Miami.
		</p>

			<term> 1</term>.  <term>(Reading Question)</term> Please watch the first four minutes of the United Nations Development Programme video below, on the impacts of sea level rise on the pacific islands of Kiribati, then answer the following questions in complete sentences, showing your work. Bring your work to class on the date below for discussion.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			What are your first impressions from the video?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			What is causing many areas of Kiribati to become uninhabitable?
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			The reason the sea-level is rising is due to rising global average temperatures. Scientists now believe that the global average temperature will increase by about 2.5 degrees Celsius by <m>2100</m> as a result of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases such as <m>CO_{2}</m> and methane in the atmosphere.
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			To convert a <term>change</term> in global average temperature to Fahrenheit, multiply by <m>2</m> (roughly). So this is a <m>5</m> degree Fahrenheit increase, turning a <q>pleasant</q> 85-degree spring day to a <m>90</m>-degree day on average.
		</p>
			</li>

		</ul></p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			This may not sound like much, but current global average temperatures are only <m>3</m> to <m>5^{\circ}</m> Celsius higher than in the last ice age, during which sea levels were about <m>122</m> m lower than they are today.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Greenhouse gases warm the earth by preventing some of the sun’s energy from escaping back to space.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The primary increases in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are from the burning of fossil fuels, transport, agriculture, and changes in land usage such as deforestation [6, p. 45-56].
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			As Walker and King note in [19, p. 188], “The world’s major industrialized countries . . . have been responsible for almost all of the current climate problem; they gained their wealth and advanced state of development largely by exploiting cheap fossil fuels at an early stage.”
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			However, it is not these wealthier industrialized countries which will experience the most severe effects of the climate changes brought about by the increased concentrations of CO2, but rather poorer nations such as those which are heavily dependent on agriculture, tourism, and fishing [3, 6, 7, 16]. Scientists believe that the global average temperature will increase by about <m>2.5^{\circ}</m> C by <m>2100</m> as a result of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Rising sea-levels will affect many aspects of life for people living in poverty and in coastal areas. Some of these aspects are: erosion [6], saline intrusion into fresh (drinking or agricultural) water [6], loss of ancestral home lands [6], loss of revenue from tourism and fishing [11], loss of revenue and utility of ports [6], increased incidences of mental health issues [6], coastal flooding [3, 19], increased disease incidence (especially due to water-born pathogens with increased flooding) [3, 16], social and political upheaval [6], and decreased crop productivity [6, 19].
		</p>

			<li>
					<p>
			Name two factors making Kiribati particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Kirabati is no more than four metres high at its highest point (about <m>12</m>-13 feet)
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			100 percent of the population lives within one kilometre of the coast (about half a mile), making this nation one of the most vulnerable to the effects of global warming
		</p>
			</li>

		</ol></p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts between 0.28 and 0.98 meters of sea level rise between <m>2009</m> and 2100 due to thermal expansion and the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. If the sea level rises at the lower level predicted by the IPCC, how many inches does it rise per year? <me>\frac{0.28\text{ meters}}{2100-2009\text{ years}}\times\frac{39.37\text{ in}}{1\text{ meter}}=\frac{0.28(39.37)\text{ meters}}{91\text{ years}}=0.12\text{ in/year}.</me>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			We’ll discuss a case study involving another Pacific island chain, the Maldives, where more reliable data is available on sea level. Since the actual shape of the Maldives is complicated, we will use a simpler shape to compute with and assume this is a good stand-in for the real islands. We will pretend the nation is one triangular prism. The width of the base is 1 km and the length of the base is 320 km. The height of the prism is 2.4 m. Convert all units to kilometers and draw a picture labeled with measurements in kilometers. What is the map area of the prism in square kilometers? By map area, in this project, we mean the area of the rectangle you would see by looking down on the prism from directly above it.

			<li>
					<p>
			How close to the true area and coastline measurements is this approximation?
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			The actual area of the Maldives is <m>297.8</m> square km.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The coastline measurements of our prism would be the perimeter of the base, which is <m>2(320)+2(1)=642</m> km.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The actual coastline of the Maldives is <m>644</m> km long–a very close approximation!
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			It could have been closer, but for simplicity, the lengths were rounded to the nearest kilometer. One can show the average height of the prism is 1.2 m, which is a little lower than the average height of the true Maldives which is approximately 1.5 m.

			<li>
					<p>
			In this module, I have chosen to focus on the Maldives because it was the lowest-lying nation for which sufficient data were available.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			In 2010, the USA’s per capita CO2 emissions were 17.6 metric tons, but the Maldives per capita CO2 emissions were 3.3 metric tons [20].
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Unfortunately, despite not being a major contributor to the problem, the Maldives is an example of a poor low-lying country which will be hit soon and hard by the effects of global climate change including sea-level rise.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The Maldives is located south-southwest of India. It consists of approximately 1,190 islands and is the lowest country in the world with a maximum elevation of 2.4 m.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Before attempting the worksheet, we need two problems’ worth of practice with applied function composition.

			<term> 2</term>.  <term>(RQ)</term> Consider the following data and the linear model that fits it (source: NOAA.gov): CO2vsTemp.png. The equation for the linear model is <m>y=0.019x+4.76</m>. Answer the following questions in complete sentences with units.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			What are the units for the slope?
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			Since the slope is computed via <m>m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>, the units of the slope are the units of the <m>y</m> variable divided by the units of the <m>x</m>-variable.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Hence, the units for the slope are <m>^{\circ}\text{C}/\text{ppm}</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

		</ul></p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			What does the slope mean in this particular situation?
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			For every increase in the CO2 concentration at Mauna Loa by <m>1</m> ppm, the average continental US temperature will increase by about <m>0.019^{\circ}</m> C.
		</p>
			</li>

		</ul></p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			What are the units for the <m>y</m>-intercept?
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			The units for the <m>y</m>-intercept are the same as the units for the <m>y</m>-variable, since the <m>y</m>-intercept is just the <m>y</m>-value when <m>x=0</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Hence, the units for the <m>y</m>-intercept are <m>^{\circ}C</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

		</ul></p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			What does the <m>y</m>-intercept mean in this particular situation?
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			The <m>y</m>-intercept would represent the average continental US temperature if the atmospheric CO2 concentration at Mauna Loa were reduced to <m>0</m> ppm. (This is impossible; some atmospheric CO2 is inevitable.)
		</p>
			</li>

		</ul></p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Use the linear model to predict what the continental US temperature, in degrees Celsius, would be if the CO2 count at Mauna Loa were 670 ppm. (This is the expected CO2 count in 2100 if the Paris climate accords of 2015 are followed to the letter.) Do you feel confident in your prediction? Why or why not?
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			We plug in <m>x=670</m> into the linear model to get theat the predicted continental average US temperature would be <me>0.019(670)+4.76=17.49^{\circ}\text{ C}\approx63.48^{\circ}\text{ F}.</me>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			I do not feel confident in this prediction because extrapolation far outside of the range of available data using a regression line is generally unfounded.

			<term> 3</term>.  The radius of an oil slick, found at <url href="https://goo.gl/9br7Cg">https://goo.gl/9br7Cg</url>, expands at a rate of <m>2</m> m/min. Follow the steps to answer the following questions.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Play with the applet as much as needed to get a sense of how the area is changing as the radius changes. What kind of function does it seem like is being traced out? Does this match what you know about circles?
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			A quadratic (parabola) function appears to be traced out. This matches the fact that the area of a circle follows the equation <m>A=\pi r^{2}</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

		</ol></p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Write a formula for the radius of the oil slick after <m>t</m> min, assuming that the slick started with a radius of <m>1</m> m.
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			The radius of the circle at time <m>t</m> is <m>r(t)=1+2t</m> m.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			This makes sense because the slope, <m>2</m>, represents the rate of change of this linear function.
		</p>
			</li>

		</ul></p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Use function composition to write a formula for the area of the slick after <m>t</m> min, assuming that the slick started with a radius of <m>1</m> m.
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			The area of the circle at time <m>t</m> satisfies the equation <m>A(t)=\pi[r(t)]^{2}</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Thus, <me>\begin{aligned}
A(t) &amp; =\pi(1+2t)^{2}=\pi(1+4t+4t^{2})\\
 &amp; =\pi+4\pi t+4\pi t^{2}\text{ m}^{2}.
\end{aligned}</me>
		</p>
			</li>
