These have attracted a tremendous amount of attention, and only the first three have been solved. In the present article, the authors provide a brief summary of each cipher and examine evidence that the fourth makes use of matrix encryption. They also provide results of brute force attacks for the 2 \texttimes{} 2 and 3 \texttimes{} 3 cases. Sanborn's latest hint was of great value in testing these possibilities. Room for further testing is indicated for those wishing to continue the attack.},

  abstract = {The cryptographic protocol based on topological knot theory,recently proposed by the authors, is improved for what concerns the efficiency of the encoding of knot diagrams and its error robustness. The standard Dowker-Thistlethwaite code, based on the ordered assignment of two numbers to each crossing of a knot diagram and not unique for some classes of knots, is replaced by a system of eight prototiles (knot mosaics) which, once assembled according to a set of combinatorial rules, reproduces unambiguously any unoriented knot diagram. A Reed-Muller scheme is used to encode with redundancy the eight prototiles into blocks and, once the blank tile is added and suitably encoded, the knot diagram is turned into an N X N mosaic, uniquely associated with a string of length 4 N\^2 bits. The complexity of the knot, measured topologically by the number of crossings, is in turn polynomially related to the number of tiles of the associated mosaic, and for knot diagrams of higher complexity the mosaic encoding provides a design of the knot-based protocol which is fault-tolerant under random 1-bit flips. It is also argued that the knot mosaic alphabet might be used in other applications which require high-capacity data transmission.},
