    "## Python Module: Frequency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency analysis is the process of counting the number of occurrences of ciphertext letters in order to make a guess about what plaintext letters they came from. Frequency analysis only works for *monoalphabetic substitution ciphers*, in which letters are always enciphered the same way (for example, every 'e' in the plaintext is enciphered as a 'T'). Frequency analysis breaks down (though it can be modified to work) in the case of *polyalphabetic substitution ciphers*, in which different occurences of a plaintext letter could be enciphered differently. (For example, one 'e' may be enciphered as a 'T' and another as an 'R'.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: For the text \"test\" the frequency of 'e' is 1, 's' is 1 and 't' is 2. The input to the function will be an encrypted body of text that only contains the capital letters A-Z. As output, we will print a list of the frequency for each of the letters A-Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, let's look at the code for a frequency count of the text \"TEST\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with an empty count_list ([0,0,0...0,0]). Each 0 in the list will eventually reflect the number of occurrences of a letter in our message.\n",
    "For example, we'll go through the message \"TEST\" looking for the letter \"A\". Since we don't find any \"A\"s, we'll leave the first 0 as a 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the code adds 26 zeroes to our list of letter counts. We want to use a \"for loop\" here rather than adding 26 zeroes to our list by hand. In other words, we want to tell our computer to \"append\" 0 to our count_list 26 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you remember how to specify the range of numbers between 0 and 25, including 0 and 25? **Edit the chunk of code below to add the correct numerical range in between the parentheses after `range` in the line `for i in range():`**"
