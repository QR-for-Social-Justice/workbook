<div class="para">For example, bills that were withdrawn, not passed by the end of a given legislative session, explicitly listed as “Dead”, or were recommended against by a committee and did not proceed in the legislature were relabeled “Dead” (at least for that year). The exception was when the bill description is specifically listed as “hearing scheduled”, “referred to committee”, carried over from another year, or otherwise makes clear that the bill is still under consideration, in which case “Introduced” or “Crossed Over” (depending on whether the bill had been passed by at least one chamber) were used.</div>
