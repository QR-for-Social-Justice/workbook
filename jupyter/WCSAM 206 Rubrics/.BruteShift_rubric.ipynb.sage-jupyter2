Notice that the second number in the parentheses is never reached. So Python's \"syntax\" (the language it uses) for number ranges is ``range(first number, last number + 1)``. \n\nBelow, write the Python command to print the numbers 1 through 23.

In other words, `for` every one of these numbers, we want to try the ShiftDecrypt process we encoded in the last module.\n\nHere's a great thing about Python: it's \"stackable\". In other words, now that we've written the code to decrypt a message with known key, we don't need to rewrite it again. We can simply copy/paste that code into this module. Then, whenever we want to try a specific key, say $7$, on a specific message, say \"GJKRGE\", we can just write\n\n``ShiftDecrypt('GJKRGE',7)``.\n\nBelow, copy/paste your function from code chunk (1.7) of the ShiftDecrypt module and run it.

Then, if we want to brute-force decrypt the message 'AJTQETA',\n\n``BruteShift('AJTQETA')``\n\nJust like a mathematical function like $f(x)=3x+2$, Sage functions have *inputs* or *independent variables* (like $x$ in the example $f(x)=3x+2$) and *outputs* or *dependent variables* (like the y-value $3x+2$). For every input $x$ (for example $x=3$), the function outputs $3$ times that input plus $2$. So for the input $3$, the function $f(x)$ spits out $11$.\n\nRemember from Codecademy that, to start defining a Sage or Python function, you have to start with a `def` command.

Is it possible to just try every possible key until you figure out what the message says?\n\nWith shift ciphers and some other simple types of ciphers, the answer is yes! This is a good reason that the shift cipher is not currently used for military purposes. It was all well and good for Julius Caesar when no one was aware that shift ciphers existed, but now that they're commonly known, any shift-ciphered message could be broken by a (not particularly bright) computer in a few seconds.\n\nBreaking a cipher by **brute force** (or a **brute-force attack**) means trying to decrypt a message using all possible keys until you find a key that generates reasonable English plaintext. \n\nLet's start with a specific example. Say you encounter the ciphertext \"PBVHFUHW\", and you know it's been encrypted using a shift cipher (with unknown key). How would you execute a brute-force attack on this message with pen and paper? In the text box below, write out the steps you would take. How many possible keys would we have to try to decrypt a message that has been enciphered using an unknown shift cipher?
