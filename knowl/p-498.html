<div class="para">What are the factors that should be used in deciding how much each country should reduce emissions? Should the population of the country play a role in making this decision? What about the overall wealth and how developed the country is? Should larger countries, like India and China, that are still developing be allowed to reduce emissions less than well-developed regions like the USA and Europe?  The effects of global warming are also unevenly distributed, with low-lying, typhoon-prone countries in Oceania and drought-prone &amp; desertifying countries in Africa being hardest hit.  These regions have lower emissions (Oceania's total is skewed up by the presence of Australia and New Zealand, both highly developed countries with higher emissions).  Should they be asked to make the same sacrifices as other nations in terms of cutting emissions, when they will also need to be dealing with the other consequences of global warming?  All of these are questions that mathematics can help us understand, by allowing us to compare the quantities involved, and the consequences of changing those quantities.</div>
